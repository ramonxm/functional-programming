1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:01,702
All right, Jeffords, what's
this meeting all about?

2
00:00:01,764 --> 00:00:02,890
I've got a full workload today.

3
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:04,297
I didn't call it. I thought you did.

4
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:05,533
What? I did no such thing.

5
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:07,408
So if neither of you called it,
then who did?

6
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,503
- Gina. Right.
- That makes sense.

7
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:10,805
Oh!

8
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:17,876
Oh, Sheila, that was awesome.

9
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:19,245
Okay, just stay here.

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,347
Wow, can't believe

11
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:22,048
I executed that to perfection.

12
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,751
- That was amazing.
- Gina, what's this all about?

13
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:26,853
I wanted to make one
final grand entrance.

14
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:28,188
Final? What do you mean?

15
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:30,323
I've decided to leave the Nine-Nine.

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,492
Which is why...

17
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,338
Oh, okay.

18
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,968
I'm handing in my two weeks' notice.

19
00:00:42,596 --> 00:00:44,853
I don't understand.
What are you gonna do?

20
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,122
I'm not sure, but Jake convinced me

21
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,990
it was time to start a new chapter.

22
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:51,894
It was time to spread my wings and fly.

23
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,363
I'm an angel. I'm an angel.

24
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:56,398
- I'm an angel.
- This is crazy.

25
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,067
I can't imagine
the Nine-Nine without you.

26
00:00:58,102 --> 00:01:00,002
Don't worry. I have
a parting gift for all of you.

27
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:02,605
I printed "Time for Gina's
Opinion" hoodies

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,156
for you with your names on them.

29
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:06,208
- Oh, there you go.
- Oh, that's fun.

30
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,576
So like "Time for Jake's Opinion"?

31
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:08,778
What are you, insane? No.

32
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:10,496
It says "Time for Gina's Opinion"

33
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:12,148
in large text on the back

34
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:13,549
and then your names are stitched

35
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,101
- really tiny on the front.
- Ah.

36
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:16,986
I had to guess at some of the spellings.

37
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:18,820
- Arnie?
- But that's not all.

38
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:20,937
Over the next two weeks,
I will be leaving

39
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:23,441
each of you with
a signature Gina Moment,

40
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:26,044
something so shocking
that it will stay with you

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,746
for the rest of your lives,

42
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:30,216
much like this interpretive dance piece,

43
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:32,653
entitled, "The Linexit."

44
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:36,088
This dance will be performed
in four movements,

45
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,458
each one expressing one aspect
of my personality.

46
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:00,795
Oh.

47
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,824
Awesome. Was that the first movement?

48
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,869
What? Are you crazy?
No. That's the warm-up.

49
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:10,422
- Each movement is 45 minutes.
- Oh, damn.

50
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:11,573
Hit it!

51
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,438

52
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,018
_

53
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:36,114
Hey, Craptain, you ready
to get curb stomped?

54
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:37,265
- What?
- At chess.

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
We have a weekly match.

56
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:39,745
I'm teaching Gina to play.

57
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:42,499
And she, in turn, is
teaching me to trash talk.

58
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:45,078
The hospital called.
Your test results came back positive.

59
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,942
You're a stage five dumbass.

60
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:48,410
Oh! You have come so far.

61
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:49,943
- You any good, Gina?
- The best.

62
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:51,983
She struggles. We've been
playing for four years now

63
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,385
and she has yet to defeat me.

64
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:55,215
Well, good luck.
I'm rooting for you, Gina.

65
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:56,417
You would take the losers side,

66
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:58,219
Jeffords, you bitch.

67
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,077
- Trash talk.
- Okay. I don't like this, I'm gonna go.

68
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,334
Really good, sir. Really good.

69
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,333
I don't know why you're
so confident you'll win.

70
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:09,081
You still don't even know
the names of all the pieces.

71
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:10,806
- You dumbass.
- Nice.

72
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:13,688
But I do know the names.
I've simply rebranded them.

73
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:16,278
My queen is Rihanna. My king is Beyoncé.

74
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:18,974
And this little guy is Kevin.

75
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:21,944
Would you be willing to murder
Kevin, the love of your life?

76
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,846
Yes. Chess Kevin means nothing to me.

77
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:25,414
Gina, have you thought this through?

78
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:28,083
Have you considered the
ramifications of what you're doing?

79
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:30,286
Yeah, I mean, I named this guy Hitchcock

80
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,197
and now I kind of
want him off the board.

81
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,440
I was talking about your decision
to leave the Nine-Nine.

82
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:36,041
Although I understand your confusion.

83
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:38,243
There are many parallels
between the game of chess

84
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:40,012
- and the game of life.
- Not really.

85
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:42,481
They're just a bunch of pieces
of wood on a placemat.

86
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:45,117
In chess, every move has consequences,

87
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:48,152
some of which won't reveal
themselves until too late.

88
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:51,123
Even a small, seemingly
insignificant decision

89
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,891
can change the course
of the entire game.

90
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:55,829
I feel like you're worried
I haven't considered

91
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:58,654
the consequences of quitting,
but I have.

92
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,624
I know you feel you could be
doing more with your life,

93
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,094
but you're leaving the
Nine-Nine without a clear plan.

94
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,663
- It's reckless.
- What you don't get,

95
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,968
but the greats do is that
in order to be successful,

96
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:09,994
sometimes you gotta be reckless.

97
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,924
Boom.

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,521
- Checkmate.
- All right, all right. I see you.

99
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:15,193
It was a good game though for a dumbass.

100
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:16,780
Okay, you're kinda overusing that one.

101
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:18,360
Maybe switch it up a little bit.

102
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:19,996
Oh, good note. You dick.

103
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:22,619
That landed good. All right,
re-rack. Let's play again.

104
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,265
Mkay, my move?

105
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:26,468
Ah, whites go first.

106
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:29,088
Oh, chess really is like life.
Commentary.

107
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:30,945
The game you love is racist

108
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,813
- and you're complicit.
- So what's your plan?

109
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:34,949
Not with chess,
with your life moving forward.

110
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,801
I mean, I could do basically anything.

111
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:39,504
I could come up with a
new form of cryptocurrency

112
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,256
called GinaCoin, make millions.

113
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,442
Could write a YA novel
about literally anything,

114
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:45,627
I think, and make millions.

115
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:47,395
I could discover a new type

116
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,430
of melon, make millions.

117
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:51,429
I'm not saying your dreams
are unattainable.

118
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,265
But you can pursue them
while you're still

119
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:54,768
gainfully employed
here at the Nine-Nine.

120
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:56,076
What's the rush to turn your back

121
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:57,573
on stability and a paycheck?

122
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:59,242
I don't want stability and a paycheck.

123
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:00,698
I wanna take a risk.

124
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:03,644
Quote: "A bird can never learn to fly

125
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,579
if it doesn't leave the nest."

126
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,748
End quote. Gina Linetti, right now.

127
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:09,884
Quote: "The bird that
leaves the nest too soon

128
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,553
plummets to its death
on the concrete below."

129
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:14,922
Captain Raymond Holt,
immediately afterwards.

130
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:16,623
Nothing bad ever happens to me.

131
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:19,093
I have a crystal in my pocket
at all times.

132
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:20,428
What about when you got hit by that bus?

133
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,396
That bus was going 60 miles per hour

134
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:25,366
and here I sit before you
completely fine.

135
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:27,463
And you wanna say crystals don't work?

136
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:28,736
Gina, I'm serious.

137
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:31,339
What if you get sick?
Healthcare is expensive.

138
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,109
What if something happens
to your daughter?

139
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,090
- Checkmate.
- Did you just delay

140
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,560
that victory by a few moves

141
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:39,812
to punctuate your point?

142
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:41,513
- I did.
- Barf. Rack 'em.

143
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,630
Okay, Captain,
you made some good points.

144
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,926
I mean, I get what you're saying
about the healthcare situation.

145
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:48,995
Checkmate.

146
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,743
I believe that you're smart enough

147
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:55,295
and talented enough
to do anything you want

148
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,155
but you have to have a plan.

149
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,750
Mm. Interesting.

150
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,251
Let me ask you something, sir.

151
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:03,870
Did you always have a plan
for everything you ever did?

152
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,522
You always thought out
every choice you ever made?

153
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:08,058
Yes. By the time I was ten,
I had mapped out my entire life.

154
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:09,793
I knew I wanted to go to the Academy.

155
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,194
I knew I wanted to become a detective.

156
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,662
- And you did it.
- Then move on to sergeant.

157
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:14,097
- And you got it.
- Next, lieutenant.

158
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,066
- Nailed it.
- And then, finally, captain.

159
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,565
Wow. I'm convinced.

160
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:19,753
I think I should reconsider my decision.

161
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,317
Uh, we're not done with the game.

162
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:22,786
I know. I just wanted to stand

163
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:25,690
so I could turn slowly and say...

164
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:28,767
But wasn't there another step

165
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:30,203
in the Holt life plan?

166
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,173
Gosh, what was it?
What came after captain?

167
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,877
I can't seem to remember
for dramatic effect.

168
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:36,323
I wanted to be commissioner.

169
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,346
- Gina Moment.
- I get your point.

170
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,740
Even the best laid plans
sometimes don't work out.

171
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,711
They sure don't. And now it's time
for Gina's closing thoughts.

172
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,579
Just because you wanna do something

173
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,157
doesn't mean you get to do it.

174
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:51,861
Life is chaos, success is
completely arbitrary,

175
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:54,264
and confidence is everything.

176
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:56,989
I was just worried.

177
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:00,560
But I guess after working
with you for five years,

178
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:02,261
I should've realized...

179
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,581
- You know what you're doing.
- Thanks, Captain.

180
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,002
Have you thought this through?

181
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,966
Not at all. And yet...

182
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:13,387
- Checkmate.
- That was completely illegal.

183
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,856
That's not at all how the queen moves.

184
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,659
That's how this queen moves. Checkmate.

185
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:17,993
It's against the rules of chess.

186
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:20,062
Well, Gina Linetti done
reinvented the game.

187
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:22,098
Uh, I'm supporting
your overall career decision,

188
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,599
I'm on board, but you can't assign...

189
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,701
I won both things.

190
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,536
Chess and the argument.

191
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:30,272
This little birdie,
she gotta fly the coop.

192
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,209
I'm taking this with me
as a little remembrance, Sir.

193
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,478
Ca-caw! Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

194
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,257
_

195
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:39,580
Hey. What are you two up to?

196
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:41,411
Eh, I'm on my phone

197
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:43,431
and Rosa's just sitting there silently.

198
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,517
- The yewzh.
- Well, I was thinking

199
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,587
we could have a ladies lunch today.

200
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,973
Amy, I wish I could do lunch today,

201
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,608
but I'm currently out of town.

202
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:54,383
Oh, come on. I wanna hang out
one last time before you...

203
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,107
before you leave us.

204
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:57,832
You're really special, Gina,

205
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,116
and even though...

206
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:01,724
I'm sorry. I just get so emotional

207
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,360
about these things, you know?

208
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:04,954
I wish I could be more like Rosa.

209
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:06,456
Huh? I got bored. What's going on?

210
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:08,124
See? She doesn't even give a damn.

211
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:09,585
I wish I could do that.

212
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,328
Then I would cry less at the bank.

213
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:12,829
It's just there's this one poster

214
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:15,885
of this older Asian man
opening up a savings account

215
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,949
- for his grandson.
- Okay.

216
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,619
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

217
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:22,472
Amy Santiago, as my parting gift to you,

218
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:24,140
before I leave your life forever...

219
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:25,712
We'll still see each other
outside of work.

220
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:27,560
Before I leave your life
forever, I'm gonna fix you.

221
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,312
I'm gonna teach you how to be more cool

222
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,898
- and detached like me and Rosa.
- What's going on?

223
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,817
But we could still go to lunch, right?

224
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:35,706
I mean... or not.

225
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:37,737
- Whatevs.
- Decent start.

226
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,823
Yeah, sure, I mean,
we'll go to lunch with you.

227
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:41,908
- Why not?
- Okay, okay, cool.

228
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:44,811
Just before we go, I'm gonna go
to go the bathroom for a bit.

229
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:46,162
Not to cry about you leaving.

230
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,665
But just to take a huge dump.

231
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,654
So if you hear any crying
from the bathroom...

232
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,854
Not about you.

233
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,229
It's the dump.

234
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,387
Okay?

235
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:58,367
Gina, since you're leaving,

236
00:08:58,403 --> 00:08:59,920
I'd like to make a toast.

237
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:01,792
Bye.

238
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,094
Oh, my God. That was perfect.

239
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,430
- Mm.
- So nice.

240
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,432
Gina, I got a little

241
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:07,251
going away present for you.

242
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,010
Don't worry. It's nothing big.

243
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:12,188
Oh, my goodness. Wow.

244
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:13,690
You once said if you ever die,

245
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,192
you wanted someone to turn
your tweets into a book,

246
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:18,111
so that's what I did.

247
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:20,947
Oh, my God. I said
so many witty things so fast.

248
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:22,042
Yeah.

249
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,566
Amy, I don't know what to say.

250
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:25,452
- This is horrifying.
- What?

251
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:27,036
This is way worse than crying.

252
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:28,705
I mean, you put so much work into this.

253
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,541
I'm completely uncomfortable.
It makes me...

254
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:32,767
Kinda makes me sick.

255
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:35,578
Amy, there's something
I want you to do right now.

256
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:37,906
- Burn the book I made you?
- Yes.

257
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:40,242
It's the only way to cleanse
your childish sentimentality

258
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,413
and become the true you,
the one that's really Rosa.

259
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:45,379
Okay.

260
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:46,531
Sure.

261
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:49,856
I mean, it does include
a very personal forward I wrote

262
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:52,395
and $75 of my best archival glue,

263
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:54,981
but... yeah, this feels good.

264
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:57,901
Hey. Never seen you burning
stuff at the bum barrel before.

265
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:58,956
Right on.

266
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:01,321
- What was in there, Hitchcock?
- Eh, eh, eh.

267
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:02,822
First rule of the bum barrel:

268
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:04,784
never ask somebody what they're burning.

269
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,770
Well, okay then.

270
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,161
All right Amy, it's time.

271
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:09,889
Put the book in the barrel. Let's go.

272
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,415
No! I can't do it.

273
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:15,344
What? I thought you
wanted us to change you.

274
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,565
I thought I did too, but I don't.

275
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:21,016
I like having emotions, okay?
This is who I am.

276
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,743
You're leaving
and that's a really big change

277
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:26,513
and I'm gonna cry about it a lot, okay?

278
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:29,766
And there it is.
Another flawless Gina Moment.

279
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,100
What? What's going on?

280
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:33,019
Amy, the lesson I wanted
to leave you with

281
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:34,971
is to just be yourself.

282
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:36,792
If you want to cry like an idiot

283
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,608
for hours on end, just do it.

284
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:39,992
You wanna make a big old ugly book

285
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:42,629
full of all my brilliant
thoughts, do it.

286
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:44,081
Do you!

287
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:46,847
Thanks, Gina.

288
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:51,843
Oh, wow.

289
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,157
That was really, really sweet.

290
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:57,443
Oh, dip! I got Rosa
to feel her feelings too?

291
00:10:57,478 --> 00:10:59,796
Inadvertent Gina Moment. Two for one.

292
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,831
Come in, my babies.

293
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:03,004
Come in.

294
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:04,517
Sorry to interrupt,
ladies, but you might

295
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:06,002
want to take a couple of steps back.

296
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:08,005
This is not going to smell good.

297
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,391
- Un-hug! Un-hug!
- Ugh!

298
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,469
_

299
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,179
Hey, does anyone have
a contact at Ellis Island?

300
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,551
Ellis Island? What's going on?

301
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:15,095
I'm trying to secure a cool venue

302
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:16,917
for Gina's going away party, Gina-rama.

303
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:20,443
Oh, that invitation said "Geena-rama"
not "Gyna-rama."

304
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,552
I thought it was weird they'd
move Gyna-rama from Tampa.

305
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:24,222
It's really a warm weather event.

306
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,609
Wait, I'm confused.
Did the Met fall through?

307
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,561
That place is stuffy and lame.

308
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,113
And also, it's $12 million.

309
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,032
But the point is, I decided.
It was my call.

310
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,368
Just have it at Shaw's.
It doesn't have to be splashy.

311
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,786
It's a party for Gina.

312
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,330
It absolutely has to be
splashy, Terrence.

313
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,907
Terrence, would you jump
into a pool without water?

314
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,692
No, the splash is what keeps you alive.

315
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,694
- Splash is life.
- I know what you need.

316
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:46,746
An insane devil stick performance.

317
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:48,864
I have a brand-new routine
that is steamy.

318
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,249
Boyle, we're looking
for splashy, not steamy,

319
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:51,801
- but thank you.
- Well, steam is what

320
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,469
you get when you add splash to fire.

321
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,887
And we will not keep you in mind.

322
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,222
Hey, that reminds me,
Gina, we still haven't

323
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,890
secured a celebrity guest for the party.

324
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,592
How would you feel about the
guy who shot that video

325
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,094
of that rat smoking a vape pen?

326
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,729
- Can we get the rat?
- Pretty sure the rat

327
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,147
is just a big ball of tumors
at this point.

328
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,550
- Is that the vibe you're going for?
- Maybe.

329
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:09,151
If you want a celebrity, I met
Leroy Pipe at Gyna-rama '08.

330
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,654
I have a buddy who works
in private security.

331
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,272
They do protection
for tons of big names.

332
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:14,657
He'll know who's in town.

333
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,576
Fantastic. Please call him right now.

334
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,329
No need. Leroy Pipe is in!
All he needs is bail money.

335
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,448
Great. But also, Terry,
you still call your guy.

336
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,751
- Gotcha.
- Gina, big news.

337
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,102
Terry's friend got back to us

338
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,637
and he says they're doing security

339
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,605
for Bayside High's number one wrestler:

340
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
A.C. Slater.

341
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:32,275
That's right, Mario Lopez.

342
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,444
Oh, my God. I had such
a big crush on him.

343
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,963
Yeah, we all had a big crush
on A.C. Slater.

344
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:39,015
Get in line!

345
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,583
I'll be cooler when we meet him.

346
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,435
- I should hope so.
- Anyways, he's hanging out

347
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,686
at the Manhattan Club right now.

348
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,804
We can go there and try and talk to him.

349
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,139
Jake, you can't just walk

350
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:48,332
into the Manhattan Club.
It's very exclusive.

351
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,619
Like, how exclusive are we
talking here, Gines? No jeans?

352
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:51,888
- More.
- No poor people of any kind

353
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:52,925
no matter how well they hide it?

354
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:54,278
- More.
- Just a tiny slice

355
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:55,280
- of the super rich?
- More.

356
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,359
Is it all Illuminati?

357
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:57,841
Is it just a whole room full of lizards?

358
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,394
- Bingo.
- Well, then I guess

359
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,930
we'll have to transform ourselves.

360
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,723
Into the uber wealthy.

361
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:16,801
Charles! Turn that music off.

362
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:18,287
Oh, sorry. I was just practicing

363
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:19,681
in case you guys change your mind.

364
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,341
Okay, we're about to walk
into the land of money.

365
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,916
Remember, all rich people are
monsters, so unleash the beast.

366
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:25,944
Got it.

367
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:27,880
Open it!

368
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:30,966
Good afternoon. May I help you?

369
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,068
We're here all the time.

370
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,519
Get familiar with these faces,

371
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:35,304
or get familiar
with the unemployment line.

372
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,690
I'm so sorry, but I
have to check you in.

373
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,974
I need a member number.

374
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,247
I don't have my member number with me.

375
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:43,912
It's too bad you can't just use
my AmEx black card.

376
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,464
Oh, that's great. We can use that.

377
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,033
You can? Well.

378
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:48,920
You think I carry around my own wallet?

379
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,674
I'm sorry, sir. If you could
just give me a name,

380
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,875
that would be great.

381
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,040
I'll give you a name:

382
00:13:57,076 --> 00:13:58,543
Pamplemouse La Croix.

383
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,547
I'm so sorry, Ms. La Croix,
you're not in the system.

384
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,715
This is ridiculous.

385
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,883
You know what?

386
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:05,835
Call Daddy. Daddy'll get us in.

387
00:14:06,537 --> 00:14:08,855
Daddy, the man won't let us
into the club.

388
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,841
- Oh, ho, ho.
- Yes, Daddy. No, Daddy, no.

389
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,889
- Daddy wants to speak with you.
- Gladly.

390
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:17,094
Hello, Daddy? Yes, Daddy. No, Daddy.

391
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,170
Daddy!

392
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,032
Oh, well, good question, Daddy.

393
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,184
Daddy wants to get this young man fired.

394
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:23,853
What is your first and last name?

395
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,788
Uh..

396
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,207
You know what, forget about it.
You can just go on up.

397
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,377
Fantastic. Everything's well, Daddy.

398
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,894
We're heading in, Daddy.

399
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,364
Gina, the bathrooms here are amazing.

400
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,083
I just peed on gold. I peed on gold!

401
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:38,868
That's so dope, but we don't have time.

402
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:40,536
Mario Lopez is right there in the VIP.

403
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:42,088
So, how do we get him
to come to your party?

404
00:14:42,123 --> 00:14:43,256
- Say we're his biggest fans?
- No, Jake.

405
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,224
Celebrities despise their fans.

406
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,835
You get into entertainment to be removed

407
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:48,721
- from general society.
- Oh, okay.

408
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:49,792
So what do we say?

409
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:52,264
Well, whilst stars hate
people, they love animals.

410
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,433
'Cause animals have bad bodies
so they're no competition.

411
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:56,552
Okay, so we say the party
is for monkeys.

412
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,738
- Monkeys with malaria.
- Malnourished malaria monkeys.

413
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,439
God, it's ridiculous how good
we are at this.

414
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,241
- Let's go in.
- Wait, I don't think

415
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,893
there's any way we're getting
past those security guards.

416
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,411
We need a distraction.
Ooh, how about this.

417
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,662
I'll sprint past them,

418
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,663
and whilst they're chasing after me,

419
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,282
you sneak into the VIP.

420
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,500
Wow, we said "whilst" twice
in this conversation.

421
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,619
I know, this place is really
rubbing off on us.

422
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:21,093
Heads up! Catch me if you...
did! You immediately did!

423
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,427
Stop it! I'm telling Daddy! Daddy!

424
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,549
_

425
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,846
Ow. Ow. Ow.

426
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:29,424
- Hey.
- Hey, homey. You okay?

427
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,980
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

428
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:32,283
It really wasn't that bad of a beating.

429
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,807
I don't know why I'm lying.
You were there. You held me as I wept.

430
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:37,810
Anyways, sorry that Gina-rama has been
a little basic so far,

431
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:39,312
but all of that is about to change.

432
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:41,480
Because guess who just
pulled up outside?

433
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:47,008
- He came?
- A.C. Sla-t-er!

434
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:48,922
Yes, dude!

435
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm sorry!

436
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:52,241
Everyone, be cool! He's here!

437
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:56,662
Hey, is this the hungry monkey thing?

438
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:58,965
It sure is, A.C. Slater!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lopez.

439
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I know you're not actually
the very iconic character

440
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:02,501
- that you played.
- You sure about that, preppy?

441
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,387
This is the best moment of my life.

442
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,505
So what's up? Can I, uh,
come in and get a drink?

443
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,008
Mm, actually, I'm sorry,
the venue's at capacity.

444
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:10,786
There's just too many people inside.

445
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:12,061
- What?
- Wait, I was told

446
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,562
that this event depended on me.

447
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,398
You just begged me, like, an hour ago.

448
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,299
And now I'm begging you
to stop embarrassing yourself

449
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:18,634
'cause it's not a good shade on you.

450
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:20,353
Are you really not gonna let me in?

451
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,071
There's nothing I can do,
I'm sor... hey, Scully.

452
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,857
Hi, Gina. I brought
my own pigs in a blanket!

453
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:26,359
- Dope.
- Who's that guy?

454
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:28,660
- Scully.
- Mario, you gotta calm down.

455
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,347
And you gotta walk away. It's over.

456
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:34,728
Hey, Gina!

457
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:35,790
What are you doing?

458
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:37,565
We had A.C. Slater right there
and you turned him away?

459
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:39,671
And that, Jake, was your Gina Moment.

460
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,375
What? But that sucked.
Why was mine a bad one?

461
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,343
Because Jake, I wanted you to understand

462
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,029
I don't need a celebrity
or some crazy venue

463
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:48,763
or a huge good-bye party.

464
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,969
This is what I wanted.

465
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:52,806
Just to hang with my friends
and have a few drinks

466
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,938
and laugh at Charles
with his devil sticks

467
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,632
until he makes eye contact...

468
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,151
you're killing it, bud.

469
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,668
You guys are all the splash that I need.

470
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:03,707
Oh, man.

471
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:06,231
- Gina.
- Mm-hmm.

472
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,234
- You big cheese ball.
- I know.

473
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:11,404
Plus, it's so cool that I got
to turn a celebrity

474
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,290
away from my party. That was
kinda my Gina Moment for me.

475
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,541
I've always wanted to do that.

476
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,376
- Right. Right.
- Hey, um...

477
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,712
It's raining outside.
Is it cool if I just wait here

478
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,964
- until my car comes?
- Get out of here, Slater!

479
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,883
Get out! Yeah?

480
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,334
Yeah!

481
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,870
_

482
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:29,877
- I can't believe Gina's gone.
- Me neither.

483
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,742
Hey, did you get a Gina Moment?

484
00:17:31,778 --> 00:17:33,328
She said she was giving one to everyone,

485
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:35,224
- but I didn't get mine.
- 'Sup, losers.

486
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,060
Oh! What are you doing here, Gina?

487
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:39,480
Are you back? Did my begging
change your mind?

488
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,650
Nah, dog. I'm just tying up
some loose ends.

489
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,286
- Gina, why are you still here?
- Jeez. What's the big deal?

490
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,405
It's just you made us all
toasts at Gina-rama

491
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,057
and say tearful goodbyes,
but now you're still here.

492
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:50,659
I'm not back. I'm just
cleaning out my desk.

493
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,229
And I have some stuff
I wanted to give to you guys.

494
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,565
Charles, weirdly,
you're kind of the person

495
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm the closest to here. Don't say why.

496
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,235
Because I was your brother
and your lover?

497
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,070
Sorry, I can't control
my tongue around you.

498
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:03,422
All right, well, here.

499
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,407
The Boyle family mother dough starter!

500
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,259
I'll think of you
every time I handle her.

501
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,294
Oh, man. You know, I never
really understood

502
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,296
the logic behind the two of us.

503
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,298
But I love you and I'm gonna miss you.

504
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,434
- I'm gonna miss you too, Gina.
- You're getting cold feet.

505
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,352
I mean, why haven't you
cleaned out your desk

506
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,305
- over your last two weeks?
- Because, Terry, I was busy

507
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,358
giving each and every one
of you a beautiful GM.

508
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,361
- Well, not all of us.
- Oh, Terry, that reminds me.

509
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,430
Rosa, do you want this plant?

510
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:30,199
- Yeah. I mess with orchids.
- Great.

511
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,451
Well, that about wraps up
everything I meant to do.

512
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,485
Come on.

513
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,488
I wonder if Holt's gonna hire
a new assistant.

514
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:38,440
Well, he can't hire someone
permanent right away.

515
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,442
He needs a rebound assistant first.

516
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:42,711
It's gonna be so weird
seeing someone at Gina's...

517
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,624
Oh. She's still here.

518
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,498
- Gina, what's going on?
- Cold feet.

519
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,634
- She's never going to leave.
- No, I wanted to make sure

520
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,170
Holt was familiar with my filing system.

521
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,838
I didn't want to leave him in the dark.

522
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:54,173
There are no dividers.

523
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,124
It's just a big pile of loose papers.

524
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,792
Okay, yeah, you get it.

525
00:18:57,827 --> 00:18:59,228
I'll stick around the rest of the day

526
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,229
in case you have any questions.

527
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,563
Never gonna leave!

528
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,815
She's definitely still gonna be here.

529
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,068
No way. She's gone. Hah! Look!

530
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,352
Her desk, I told you, it's empty.

531
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,304
She's right over there burning stuff.

532
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,191
I'm just sage-ing. Trying to
clear this place of my energy.

533
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:13,642
- Why?
- Cold feet.

534
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:16,361
No. No one's paying me
for my vibes anymore.

535
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm not trying to give
'em away for free.

536
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,998
Oh, my God. I know what's going on.

537
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,500
Gina, you're having second thoughts.

538
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,001
You have cold feet. I figured it out!

539
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,536
Jake for the win. There you go.

540
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:26,371
- Come on, man!
- I never have second thoughts.

541
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:29,208
That's the luxury of having
great first thoughts.

542
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:31,093
Gina, it's okay. You're scared.

543
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,544
Tare-bear, I love you, but don't try

544
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,012
- and hop on my thing, okay?
- But for real.

545
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,042
I'm not scared.

546
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,934
Hey, guys. You were right.

547
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,103
I'm scared as hell. Anyway.

548
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,605
- I'm here all day.
- Huh.

549
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,391
All right. I think we need
to all get on the same page

550
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,060
for what do to about
this Gina situation.

551
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,394
Well, we should tell her
we believe in her.

552
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,113
- Good point, Charles.
- And we all know

553
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,447
she'll succeed at whatever she tries.

554
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,349
I feel like this is all my fault.

555
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:56,535
She's staying for me.
She just can't let go.

556
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,070
Hitchcock, you don't have to contribute.

557
00:19:58,105 --> 00:19:59,204
All right, guys, let's get in there

558
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,503
and support the hell out of Gina.

559
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,042
What is that?

560
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,127
It's a statue of her.

561
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,295
Texting on her phone.

562
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,023
Guys, look, there's a note.

563
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:10,504
<i>Hello, Nine-Nine.</i>

564
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,467
<i>I just wanted to thank you guys.</i>

565
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,219
<i>I was so nervous to move on</i>

566
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,054
<i>and I even started to doubt myself,</i>

567
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,539
<i>which is crazy.</i>

568
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:20,142
<i>And your kind words really helped me,</i>

569
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,523
<i>- especially yours, Terry.</i>
- Aww.

570
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:24,313
<i>Psych!</i>

571
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,648
<i>Did he fall f...
Terry, did you fall for it?</i>

572
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,268
<i>Anyway, Terry, that's your Gina Moment.</i>

573
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:31,553
Seriously? I've known
her for seven years.

574
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:34,389
<i>JK again. I'm really gonna
miss you, Sarge.</i>

575
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:35,991
<i>I signed you up for an international</i>

576
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,392
<i>yogurt of the month club.</i>

577
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:39,444
<i>Austria is in the fridge right now.</i>

578
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,496
Terry's never had
Austrian yogurt before.

579
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,989
Terry had the best moment of all.

580
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,284
<i>Anyway, I didn't doubt
myself for one second.</i>

581
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,169
<i>And I'm more confident
than I've ever been.</i>

582
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,905
<i>I was only stalling because
there was a shipping delay</i>

583
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,107
<i>- with my golden statue.</i>
- Ah, that makes sense.

584
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:54,509
<i>And even though she looks
like she has wet hair</i>

585
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,346
<i>and just combed through
a deep conditioning treatment,</i>

586
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,414
<i>and even though her jeans look cheap</i>

587
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,650
<i>and even though she has sausage fingers,</i>

588
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:04,486
<i>I hope it reminds you of me,
and I'm gonna miss you.</i>

589
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:07,205
<i>I'll hold now for a five
minute applause break.</i>

590
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:10,476
<i>Do it! Please.</i>

591
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:15,347
<i>Thank you, thank you. Thank you.</i>

592
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:16,682
This feels right.

593
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:17,966
<i>I love you guys.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
