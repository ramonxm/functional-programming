1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,421
Bottles.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,190
Boyle. Bullpen.

3
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,480
- What are you...
- Buh-buh-buh.

4
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:12,410
Bottles, Boyle, bullpen.

5
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:13,677
Bowling.

6
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,711
Behold, Brooklyn buddies,

7
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,725
Boyle bullpen bottle bowling.

8
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,432
- Beautiful.
- Be brave, bro.

9
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:20,468
Be brave.

10
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:21,768
Bowl!

11
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:29,320
- Bam!
- Bull's-eye!

12
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:30,288
Booyah!

13
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:33,345
Babushka!

14
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:38,317
Babushka!

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,969

16
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,161
<i>Jakey, I've got a hot case for you.</i>

17
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:01,188
<i>Ooh, hit me.</i>

18
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:03,339
Okay, Susan Buckley was reported missing

19
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,517
by her psychiatrist, Dr. William Tate.

20
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:07,454
He thinks that her husband James

21
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,756
may have had a mental break

22
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:09,991
and done something terrible to her.

23
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:11,427
Ooh, that is a hot case.

24
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,831
Missing woman, psycho husband,
creepy shrink.

25
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,166
Dr. Tate was actually quite a nice man.

26
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:16,902
Yeah, but you know, he's a psychiatrist,

27
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:18,939
so he's automatically a creep.
I've seen movies.

28
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,479
They all turn into super sophisticated,

29
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:21,881
Chianti-loving cannibals.

30
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,284
Wait, have you never been to therapy?

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,963
- No. Don't need it.
- Not even after the time

32
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:26,045
- your wife shot you?
- Nope.

33
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:27,514
What about when you
were held at gunpoint

34
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,917
and had to write your own suicide note?

35
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:30,686
Oh, that was crazy. I forgot about that.

36
00:01:30,722 --> 00:01:32,089
Or when you were falsely
accused of bank robbery

37
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,591
- and went to prison?
- Was that a big deal?

38
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,247
You joined a gang and tried meth!

39
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,393
I didn't want to be anyone's bitch.

40
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,129
Look, it sounds like
these things affected you

41
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,724
more than they affected me.
Maybe you should go to therapy.

42
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,422
I do. Terry needs a safe space

43
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,597
to process his emotions.

44
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,153
I go twice a week.
Couples counseling with my dad,

45
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,243
and then a solo sesh with Dr. Tyler.

46
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:50,395
Okay, unlike Kooky Charles
and Tearful Terry,

47
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,931
I am healthy and don't need therapy.

48
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:54,292
I hear that.
I don't go to therapy either.

49
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,395
Jake and I are like
two penises in a pod.

50
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,998
Damn it, Hitchcock,
we talked about this.

51
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,367
It never helps when you back me up.

52
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:00,472
Let's just go, Charles.

53
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:03,343
Come in, Diaz.

54
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,920
- How'd you know it was me?
- The restrained knock.

55
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:07,155
Everyone else in this office

56
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,744
plays my door like it's a marimba.

57
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,925
The other day,
Jeffords gave it three taps

58
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:12,761
- and two raps.
- Was he drunk?

59
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:14,197
- One can only assume.
- Mm.

60
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,100
Anyway, I wanted to invite
you and Jocelyn

61
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,702
to dinner at my house this weekend.

62
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,585
Kevin will be making his famous rice.

63
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:22,087
Thank you for the invite,
but I'm not really

64
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:23,322
having people meet Jocelyn yet.

65
00:02:23,357 --> 00:02:24,486
I'm still feeling things out with her.

66
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:27,023
But Boyle says you brought
Jocelyn to Shaw's last week.

67
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:28,057
That was unplanned.

68
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:30,897
Sure, but now that the squad has
all met her, surely you can't object

69
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,493
to her having some rice
with Kevin and me?

70
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:35,758
Okay, it's just that
you can be a bit... judgmental.

71
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:36,961
What a stupid thing to say.

72
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:38,697
Name one time
when I have been judgmental.

73
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,232
- Okay.
- What a stupid thing to say.

74
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:42,516
Oh, I see. Mere seconds ago.

75
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:44,100
Sir, Jocelyn is not like us.

76
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:45,507
- She has feelings.
- Huh.

77
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,243
Are you positive
this is the woman for you?

78
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,421
That is exactly the type of thing

79
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:50,157
I don't want you to say in front of her.

80
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:51,599
Sorry. It's not gonna happen.

81
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:56,602
Kevin, they're not coming.

82
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,845
Yes, I know you've already
started soaking the rice.

83
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:01,316
Couldn't we just eat it ourselves?

84
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:05,945
I understand you purchased
four portions of rice.

85
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:09,259
Yes, that's a great idea.

86
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,412
We'll eat the extra rice for breakfast.

87
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:14,518
I love you, as well.

88
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,953
Hey, Sarge, a package was delivered

89
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,757
to my desk downstairs,
addressed to the 99th Precinct,

90
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,207
attention: Sergeant,
but it's not for me.

91
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:23,699
It's a book.

92
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,101
Sounds like something you'd order.

93
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:26,357
"How to Please Your Wife:

94
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:28,770
100 Tips to Take Your Sex Life
from Blah to Ahhhh."

95
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:30,838
Yeah. That's not mine.

96
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:33,784
It also shipped with two
gallons of protein powder.

97
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,523
Well, I get my protein from real food.

98
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,947
22 meals a day, 1 every 40 minutes.

99
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,031
It's not a big deal, okay?
Just take the book.

100
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,634
I promise I won't tell anyone.

101
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,538
Hey, Sarge,
I heard you need some sex tips.

102
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:48,338
Except for the people I already told.

103
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:50,652
Here's the big one:
just lie flat on your back.

104
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,528
- Women love to do all the work.
- Ugh.

105
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:56,178
That's very incorrect,
and I don't need sex tips!

106
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:58,124
Okay, we'll just leave the book here,

107
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,943
and whoever did order it can
take it when nobody's looking.

108
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,270
It's not mine!

109
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,395
Terry doesn't order books online.

110
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:06,065
He supports local bookstores.

111
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,421
They're dying, Amy!

112
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:10,078
Oh, that guy looks like
he's wearing a skin mask

113
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:12,248
over his own face,
so I'm guessing it's Dr. Tate.

114
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:13,765
He has a normal man's face, Jake.

115
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:15,701
Yes, he does have a normal man's face,

116
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:17,363
stretched out over his own face,

117
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,562
because he is a Hannibal.

118
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,501
Hi there. Dr. Tate, I presume.

119
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:21,837
Yes. Hi, nice to meet you.

120
00:04:21,873 --> 00:04:23,473
Uh, which one of you is in charge?

121
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,275
- Let the mind games begin.
- Excuse me?

122
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:26,778
Sorry, I am Detective Peralta.

123
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:28,681
This is Detective Boyle. He's in charge.

124
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,817
Dr. Tate, have you heard
anything from Mrs. Buckley?

125
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,769
No, I haven't, and I'm quite worried.

126
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,105
I received a frantic,

127
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,408
disturbing call from James yesterday.

128
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,362
He was afraid
he'd done something horrible.

129
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,170
I asked him where he was,

130
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:42,573
and he said he was in the park
near the Zen garden.

131
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:45,377
I suspected he was just
experiencing delusions,

132
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:47,547
but when they didn't show up
for therapy today,

133
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,856
I became very concerned.

134
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:50,059
So you think he killed her

135
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,294
and dumped her body in the park?

136
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,463
Sounds like couples counseling

137
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,608
is going really great for them.

138
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,645
Sorry, my partner
doesn't believe in therapy.

139
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,681
Oh, that's fine.
It's hard for some people.

140
00:04:57,717 --> 00:04:59,099
Title of your sex tape.

141
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:02,662
Are you normally so cavalier
around murder investigations?

142
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:05,573
Yes, we see a lot of darkness
in our line of work,

143
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,510
and humor is one
of our coping mechanisms.

144
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,283
It's self-preservation
through disassociation.

145
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,181
What the [bleep]?

146
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:11,957
It's something I've been
working on with my therapist.

147
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:14,775
Well, I act like this

148
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:17,379
because I'm cool and fun and
people like being around me.

149
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,348
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to trigger you.

150
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,711
Okay, Doc, you're not in your office.

151
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:23,148
You don't have to use words
like "triggered" or "in denial."

152
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:25,484
I didn't say "in denial."
Are you in denial?

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,954
No, I am not,
and before you say anything,

154
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,757
I don't want to sleep
with my mom either.

155
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,690
Now, why would you
bring that up unprompted?

156
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:32,925
What? You prompted it.

157
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,428
Jake, there's a body over here.

158
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:35,503
Oh, thank God.

159
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:37,038
I mean, "Oh, no, death."

160
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,218
I mean... I don't want to sleep
with my mom, okay?

161
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,534
I know this is the wrong
takeaway from this case board,

162
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,119
but I really love the
new yarn you're using.

163
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:45,884
- There are sparkles in it.
- I noticed.

164
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,268
Okay, so let's go over what we got.

165
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,631
No witnesses, no weapon.
Bruising indicates a struggle.

166
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,258
No conclusive DNA found at the scene

167
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:52,793
other than from the three of us
who found the body.

168
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,417
And our chief suspect,
James Buckley, has disappeared.

169
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:57,220
But he has no motive,
no criminal record,

170
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,589
and according
to his credit card statement,

171
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,577
had just purchased two sombreros.

172
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:01,746
Kind of weird to give someone a sombrero

173
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:03,087
when you're about to murder them.

174
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:05,081
Well, both <i>sombreros</i>
could have been for him.

175
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:06,682
It's always good
to have a backup <i>sombrero.</i>

176
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:07,817
Please stop pronouncing it like that.

177
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:08,984
What, pronouncing <i>sombreros</i>

178
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,083
- like <i>sombrero?</i>
- Yes.

179
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,229
Fine, if you want me
to pronounce it the wrong way.

180
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:14,257
Look, I think James is a good suspect.

181
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,725
We have Dr. Tate's notebooks,

182
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,527
and they specifically mention
that he's been having

183
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,195
violent fantasies
for the last few months.

184
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,531
And you want us to just
blindly trust Dr. Tate?

185
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:23,379
He's a creepy therapist. They all are.

186
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,281
What kind of profession
requires a couch?

187
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,218
Lots of them. My cousin Pam has a couch

188
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,221
in his bird store.
Would you call that creepy?

189
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,407
Yes! Decidedly so.

190
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,176
You always get upset
when I bring up Pam.

191
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,082
Whatever. Can we please just
go check out James's apartment?

192
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:35,988
Mm-hmm.

193
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,452
Hello, gentlemen. How is your day going?

194
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,687
Great. I just woke up
from my morning nap.

195
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,923
I mean, my... morning nap.

196
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,897
It's fine.
It's good to be rested at work.

197
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,544
Okay. Are you trying to prove
that you can be nonjudgmental?

198
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,530
Rosa, I didn't see you there.

199
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:57,382
I was just having a friendly
chat with my employees.

200
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:59,936
So, uh, boys, tell me, what are
you doing this weekend?

201
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:03,042
Well, we're going to a sauce
launch party at Wing Slutz.

202
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:05,441
Sounds like a neat cultural event.

203
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:07,150
They're introducing
a new dairy-based sauce

204
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,939
called Cream Dream.

205
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:10,680
Mmm.

206
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,815
And everyone who comes
gets a free bucket.

207
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,979
You want to know what that's called?

208
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,551
- Of course I do.
- No, you don't.

209
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:17,286
None of us do. You proved your point.

210
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,122
If you want to meet Jocelyn
so bad, you can.

211
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,217
You win.

212
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:21,557
Okay, well, that's Friday night.

213
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:23,292
Now, every Saturday morning,

214
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:24,527
we go to the public baths.

215
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,078
I get it. You lead colorful lives.

216
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,430
Let's end this, shall we?

217
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,366
Okay, so the neighbors say
they haven't seen or heard

218
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:32,502
any activity in
the Buckleys' apartment, and...

219
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:33,836
What is he doing here?

220
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,505
If we find James and he's unstable,

221
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,839
Dr. Tate could talk him down.

222
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,207
- Hello, Peralta.
- Plus, on the ride over,

223
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,709
- he gave me a quickie.
- A what?

224
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,477
A quick therapy session.
We talked about so much.

225
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,812
Did you know that I have a tendency

226
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,514
- to be unconsciously sexual?
- Yes.

227
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:45,515
It's a real tough nut to bust.

228
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,016
Oh, you're doing it again.

229
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,484
Oh, okay, I think I hear it.

230
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,852
- You think you hear it?
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,722
Whatever, let's just do this, okay?

232
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:53,191
NYPD, open up.

233
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:56,726
That's weird.

234
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,361
- The door's unlocked.
- That's too bad.

235
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,595
I love watching you pound one out.

236
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,364
- Charles.
- What? That was sexual?

237
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,665
- Which part?
- All of the parts!

238
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,854
All right, you stay here.

239
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,034
Charles, we're going in.

240
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:11,620
- Bedroom's clear.
- The kitchen's clear.

241
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:13,042
Did you see anything suspicious?

242
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,277
Nothing, except for these

243
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:16,090
laughing Jesus paintings everywhere.

244
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,448
- Why is he in front of a tepee?
- I don't know.

245
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:20,417
The one in the kitchen has him
at the last supper,

246
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,353
but all the apostles
are McDonald's characters.

247
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,952
- Which one's Judas?
- The Hamburglar.

248
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,788
Knew it as soon as I asked.
You check the bathroom?

249
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:27,423
- No, where is it?
- It's right over there.

250
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,460
- Clear.
- Cool.

251
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,043
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Well, Dr. Tate,

252
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,068
we will meet you back at the car.

253
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:36,076
We just want to check some
things out for one more minute.

254
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,201
- Did you notice that?
- The painting in the bathroom

255
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:39,340
of Jesus standing over a vent

256
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:40,809
with his robe blowing up
like Marilyn Monroe?

257
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:42,937
No. Dr. Tate is the killer.

258
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,372
- Hey, Santiago.
- Hey.

259
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,743
Can you help me put up
these flyers around the office?

260
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:48,755
Mm-hmm.

261
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:50,766
"Lost sex book. Delivered by accident

262
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:53,069
to Sergeant Jeffords,
who doesn't need it."

263
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:54,204
Terry, come on.

264
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,740
Nobody cares about your sex life.

265
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:56,909
Just take the book home.

266
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:01,591
Take someone else's book home?

267
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,626
That's stealing and mail fraud.

268
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:05,731
I can't believe
you would even suggest that.

269
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,034
Look, I think it's so great

270
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,262
that you've been married so long

271
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,931
and want to keep it fresh.

272
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,668
I hope Jake does that for me if
our sex life ever takes a dip.

273
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,503
Dip? Oh, there is no dip.

274
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:16,739
- Just ask Sharon.
- Oh, no, please.

275
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:18,574
I don't want to do that.
That's not necessary.

276
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:20,564
- It's okay. I believe you.
- Hey, hon.

277
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:23,930
Yeah, could you tell Amy
how good I am in bed?

278
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,704
Because I'm a sex machine who...

279
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,120
Oh, on speaker?

280
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:30,905
Oh, hey, girls. How was school?

281
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:32,788
Why do you think
Dr. Tate's the murderer?

282
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,156
He already knew where the bathroom was.

283
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,658
He's clearly been here before.

284
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:37,994
Well, he probably just
guessed, because it's obvious.

285
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,095
This is New York.

286
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,614
It's never obvious
where the bathroom is.

287
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,150
I once had an apartment where the toilet

288
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:43,633
was literally in the refrigerator.

289
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,668
I bet he was sleeping with Susan.

290
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:47,503
Therapists are always having
affairs with their patients.

291
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:48,971
- That's not true.
- Oh, really?

292
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,673
Tell that to the ten minutes
of "Bikini Shrink"

293
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,775
I watched on Cinemax when I was 13.

294
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,477
Dr. Juggs was insatiable.

295
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,512
James was ill. We have months of notes

296
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:57,980
saying he was increasingly unstable.

297
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,882
First of all, people with mental illness

298
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,684
are much more likely to be the
victims than the perpetrators.

299
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,486
I heard that on NPR
when I was in the room

300
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,987
- while Amy was listening to NPR.
- Ah.

301
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,657
And second, I bet
Dr. Tate's notes are fake.

302
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,278
I mean, you know what
was in Dr. Juggs's notes?

303
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:10,726
- What?
- Stick figures doing it.

304
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,737
- What does that prove?
- I don't know, but it was hot.

305
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,331
All I'm saying is, something
feels suspicious to me here.

306
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,799
Maybe we should go to Dr. Tate's office

307
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,301
and see if we can find
the missing notebooks.

308
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:19,468
Wait, you're basing this all on the fact

309
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:21,170
that he knew where a bathroom was?

310
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,372
And his DNA was at the scene
where we discovered the body.

311
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,740
I bet that's why

312
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:26,475
he insisted on coming
with us to the park.

313
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,177
You've been weird
about Dr. Tate from the start.

314
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,345
To me, the evidence suggests

315
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,880
that James killed his wife and fled.

316
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:33,123
It's my case, and that's
the lead we're following.

317
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,084
Okay.

318
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,519
You're right. I'm sorry.

319
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,254
I was being unfair. It's your case.

320
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,522
You call in an APB,

321
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:40,823
and I will meet you back
at the precinct.

322
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,265
I'm just gonna swing by the bank.

323
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,693
You're not gonna go to Dr. Tate's office

324
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:44,860
and search it behind my back, are you?

325
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:45,695
What? Charles, no.

326
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,266
I wouldn't do that. You can trust me.

327
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:49,162
- Okay, I trust you.
- Good. You should.

328
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,558
- Well, I do.
- Great, because you can.

329
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:51,734
- I feel good about it.
- Good, you should.

330
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,102
I think it's the right choice.

331
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:54,690
You're making the right call
by trusting me.

332
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:55,972
Not.

333
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,705
"Wayne's World." Sweet.

334
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:05,109
All right, think.

335
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:06,988
Where would I hide the real notebook

336
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,557
if I was a creepy therapist?

337
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:10,578
In my butt.

338
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:12,272
Focus, Jake.

339
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:13,856
Now is not the time for being hilarious.

340
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:23,115
What have we here?

341
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:25,885
James and Susan Buckley.

342
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:32,425
So your day's been going well?

343
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,260
- It has, it has.
- They're blocking my way out.

344
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,029
A cancellation, and so I was able

345
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:37,864
to get more work done.

346
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,299
Yeah. Well, that's always nice.

347
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:40,867
Same thing happened to me yesterday.

348
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:43,569
- Is that right?
- Yeah, two cancellations.

349
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,306
You know? At least it wasn't three.

350
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,874
Have a good afternoon.

351
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:48,875
- You too.
- Okay.

352
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,410
See you in the morning.

353
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:52,315
Oh, um, can I help you?

354
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:53,351
Yes.

355
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:55,541
I am...

356
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:57,884
your new patient.

357
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,232
- Garrett?
- Garrett...

358
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:00,920
is my name, yes.

359
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:02,455
You're an hour and a half early.

360
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,258
I know. I have problems
with time management.

361
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:06,960
That's the issue I want to talk about.

362
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,728
On the phone,
you said you were concerned

363
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:10,330
you might have
multiple personality disorder.

364
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:11,817
Yep, that too.

365
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:13,333
Got buttloads of peeps
living in my brain,

366
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:14,834
no doubt, no doubt, no doubt,
no doubt, no doubt.

367
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:15,809
We should talk about it.

368
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:18,672
I can't believe it's taken
so long for us to meet.

369
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,974
You're so nice.

370
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,310
Oh, I don't know about that, Jocelyn.

371
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:22,646
I'm just being myself.

372
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:24,215
Well, you're very sweet

373
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,911
about the cosmetology thing.

374
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,847
A lot of people are dismissive
of hairstylists.

375
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,282
It makes no sense.

376
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,250
If we didn't have hairstylists
to cut our hair,

377
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:32,919
our hair would be far too long.

378
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:34,954
Wow, great compliment.

379
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,322
Hey, you're the girl

380
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:37,957
from the diarrhea commercial,
aren't you?

381
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,325
You get diarrhea on the plane.

382
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,860
- That's not true.
- Yeah, move along.

383
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:42,628
I don't get diarrhea on the plane.

384
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,298
I get diarrhea in the airport.

385
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:47,609
What's going on?

386
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,969
Are you... an actor?

387
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,306
Well, you don't have to
sound so grossed out.

388
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:55,641
I can see why you didn't want
him meeting Jocelyn.

389
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,443
- Excuse me?
- This isn't Jocelyn.

390
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:59,112
It's Sheena. She's an actress.

391
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,373
Yeah, I was in an episode of "SVU."

392
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,049
I say, "We want answers."

393
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,417
The director tried to replace me,

394
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:06,719
but Mariska said
it would take too much time,

395
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:09,288
and then they all agreed
I'd probably cut together fine.

396
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:12,325
Look, Diaz, I've obviously
misread our relationship.

397
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,227
You didn't want me to meet
the real Jocelyn

398
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:17,663
because we're not as close
as I thought we were, so...

399
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:19,764
message received.

400
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:24,918
Hey, so you don't by any chance

401
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,154
need any molly, do you?

402
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,057
- I'm a cop.
- And scene.

403
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:30,932
Now I'm out of character,
and I don't sell any drugs.

404
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:31,967
I am leaving.

405
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:33,279
So, Garrett,

406
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:34,680
where would you like to begin?

407
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,983
You know what,
can we crack the door a little?

408
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:38,618
I get very claustrophobic,

409
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:41,354
probably from all the different
people living in my head.

410
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,256
We usually keep it closed for privacy,

411
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,003
but whatever makes you comfortable.

412
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,011
Thank you.

413
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:49,929
Damn it, he's still here.

414
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,182
- Excuse me?
- Hmm?

415
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:54,756
Uh, I was just talking
to another one of the voices.

416
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,225
- Is it Tatiana?
- Who now?

417
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:57,728
The mischievous
seven-year-old British girl

418
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:59,064
you told me about on the phone?

419
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,232
May I speak with her?

420
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:02,045
Uh...

421
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:05,422
Yes?

422
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,590
Hello, Doctor.

423
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,116
I'm from Wussex.

424
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:11,617
Is that an actual place in England?

425
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:12,818
How should I know?

426
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,221
I'm just a little girl, I am, I am.

427
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,290
Well, it's nice to speak
with you, Tatiana.

428
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:19,959
Can I say hello to Brian,

429
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:22,098
the bookkeeper from Central London?

430
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:24,697
Cheers, I'm Brian.

431
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:27,633
I like bookkeeping
right in the middle of London.

432
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:31,637
Did I tell you a full list
of my many personalities

433
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,138
when I called you
on the ol' telly, innit?

434
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:34,173
Yes, you did.

435
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,482
And are any of 'em, hopefully,

436
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:38,311
not from England?

437
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:39,312
There's Geoffrey.

438
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,913
You said he's Australian.

439
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,642
Aww, crikey.

440
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,151
Hey, Sarge. I saw the flyers.

441
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,554
You really put a lot of them up, huh?

442
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,223
I just want to make extra sure

443
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:51,691
we find the real book-buyer.

444
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:54,660
Do you think it's this
kind of overcompensation

445
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:57,330
that's been making things
difficult in the bedroom?

446
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:59,208
Oh, I don't compensate.

447
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,295
I procreate. Three kids.

448
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,502
Okay. Weird brag.

449
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,871
Look, just take the book. Nobody cares.

450
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:09,108
Hey, I just saw this.
I think you have my book.

451
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,911
Oh, really?

452
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,379
Told ya!

453
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,047
But you're not even married, Scully.

454
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,682
I'm in a committed relationship,

455
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,584
and Cindy Shatz
says I'm a selfish lover.

456
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,419
All right, well, what
about the protein powder?

457
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:21,621
I'm trying to get ripped.

458
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:22,855
I drink, like, six shakes a day,

459
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,090
but nothing's happening.

460
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,358
- Do you also exercise?
- What?

461
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:26,525
You're supposed to exercise?

462
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,027
You know what, keep the powder.

463
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:29,528
I'll drink normal milkshakes.

464
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:32,131
And you thought that was my book.

465
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,029
Shame on you, Amy.

466
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:35,287
Shame on you.

467
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:39,241
You got the book?

468
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,776
You should know,
things are good with Sharon.

469
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:46,045
I just want to make sure we're
as happy in our relationship

470
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,380
- as we can be.
- That's nice, Sarge.

471
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:48,581
Sorry you had to embarrass yourself.

472
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:49,715
Not a big deal.

473
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,697
I guess I just don't care
what other people think of me.

474
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,252
That's actually pretty inspiring.

475
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,487
I wish I was more like that.

476
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:55,853
Yeah. Now, if you'll excuse me...

477
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:58,457
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

478
00:15:58,492 --> 00:15:59,827
You're not gonna wait for me to leave?

479
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:02,694
Like I said, I just don't care.

480
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,731
Well, Garrett, our time is up.

481
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,067
Shall we pick up here next week?

482
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:10,403
No, I can't go.

483
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:14,307
There's still someone
left inside that wants to talk.

484
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:15,508
Do you mean Satchel,

485
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:17,977
the "gentle African-American man

486
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:19,577
who was born in 1908"?

487
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,515
Oh, no, you know what?

488
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,116
Satchel probably shouldn't
come out right now.

489
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,251
Or ever, for that matter.

490
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:26,952
Garrett, I can only help you

491
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,242
if you open up.

492
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,858
And then Dufresne

493
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:36,917
escaped through the tunnels
of Shawshank Prison.

494
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,498
He was my friend.

495
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,399
Are you just doing Morgan Freeman?

496
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,135
Ah, yes!

497
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,437
You calling me on it

498
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:45,705
just gave me a major breakthrough.

499
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,817
I'm cured! Anyway, deuces, Doc!

500
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,682
I've got you now, you son of a bitch.

501
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,351
Hello, Peralta.

502
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,953
You really thought you could
sneak around my office

503
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:02,288
without me noticing, huh?

504
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:03,389
How'd you know I was in there?

505
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,291
Your shampoo left an odor.

506
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:06,659
I could smell you.

507
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:09,860
I knew it! You're a Hannibal.

508
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,262
Pull over right here. Cut the engine.

509
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,288
Why are you doing this?

510
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:18,824
Because you found my notebooks,

511
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,226
and I assume you've deduced
what I did to Susan and James.

512
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:23,962
- You killed James too?
- Oops.

513
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,631
I guess you only deduced the Susan part.

514
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,898
But it doesn't matter.

515
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:29,003
You never would have thought
that James was a suspect.

516
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,373
He was such a kind and gentle man.

517
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:32,942
So why did you kill them?

518
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:34,478
Well, because
they were gonna tell people

519
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:37,148
about my affair with Susan
and ruin my career.

520
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:38,884
- I knew it.
- I had to do it

521
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,287
for the sake of my other patients.

522
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:41,989
You know, there are a lot of people

523
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:43,525
who depend on me for their well-being.

524
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,562
Yeah, except for the ones
that you murder.

525
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,065
- That's only happened twice.
- It's happened before?

526
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,001
The Rothmans. Nobody misses them.

527
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:51,971
You really are a terrible therapist.

528
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:54,541
Oh, wow, strong words for someone

529
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:57,745
who is clearly scared
to talk about his own issues.

530
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:59,547
I'm not scared, okay?

531
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,017
For example, I had an issue

532
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:02,753
with texting while driving,
but I fixed it.

533
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:04,891
Now I just don't look
at my phone while I type.

534
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,893
Case in point.

535
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:07,061
Just know that you died

536
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:08,589
without saying anything real.

537
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,014
Okay, okay, okay! Stop.

538
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:11,531
Fine, you want something real?

539
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,300
I tried therapy.
It only made things worse.

540
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:14,836
Uh-huh. Go on.

541
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:17,607
When I was a kid,
I was acting out at school,

542
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,943
so they made me and my parents
do family counseling,

543
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,046
but instead of helping me
with my problems,

544
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:23,315
the stupid therapist just brought up

545
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:24,618
all my parents' issues.

546
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:26,287
And once it was all out in the open,

547
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:27,889
they fought all the time
and eventually got divorced,

548
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:31,394
and everything good in my life
just... went away.

549
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,063
Interesting. So you actually

550
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,533
blame yourself
for your parents' divorce?

551
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,370
No, I blame the therapy,

552
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:39,139
which we only had to do because I...

553
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:40,408
oh, my God.

554
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:41,848
I do blame myself.

555
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:44,496
Oh, here come the waterworks.

556
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:50,932
Excuse me, do you have
a less crinkly dollar

557
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:52,801
- I could trade you for?
- Of course I do.

558
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:54,696
None of my dollars has a single crinkle.

559
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:56,632
When they do, I steam them.

560
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,503
Oh. Wow, that is crisp.

561
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,673
Can't wait to get this baby
home and flatten it out.

562
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:04,378
- Almonds, nice choice.
- Oh, thanks.

563
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:05,713
They're, uh... they're not for me.

564
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:07,950
They're for my girlfriend,
Detective Diaz.

565
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:10,653
Oh, you must be Jocelyn.

566
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:12,156
What? No, I'm Denise.

567
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,592
Who's Jocelyn? Is Rosa cheating on me?

568
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:16,562
Oh, my...

569
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:17,947
No, that was a joke.

570
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:19,518
I'm sorry, I thought it would be funny.

571
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:20,854
I am Jocelyn.

572
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:23,855
Oh, that was actually very funny.

573
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,121
I didn't know what was happening,

574
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,423
and then I thought
I knew what was happening,

575
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,959
but what I thought I knew was happening

576
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:30,138
wasn't what was happening.

577
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,225
That's very good.

578
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,527
- You must be Captain Holt.
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:33,898
- Hey.
- Hey.

580
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:34,961
Uh, can you give us a second, babe?

581
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:36,297
Yeah, I'll wait out there.

582
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,666
Pleasure to meet you, Captain.

583
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:41,840
So this is Jocelyn?

584
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,543
I'm glad you got to meet her.
For the record,

585
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,346
I wasn't keeping her from you
because I was afraid

586
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:46,748
you were gonna hurt
her feelings by being judgy.

587
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:48,365
I think it's hilarious
when you're judgy.

588
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:50,476
It's because I was afraid
you weren't gonna like her.

589
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,265
You and I are close, and I...

590
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:54,519
I value your opinion.

591
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:55,621
Well, she seems great,

592
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:57,024
in our limited interaction.

593
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,293
Maybe you could get to know her better

594
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:00,229
over Kevin's rice this weekend?

595
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,408
That would be great.

596
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,321
You might want to save your girlfriend.

597
00:20:03,357 --> 00:20:04,438
She's talking to Hitchcock.

598
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:05,874
Damn it, Hitchcock!

599
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,732
So I joke about my father so much

600
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:10,470
to avoid processing
all the pain he's caused me.

601
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:13,207
Yes. You are doing such great work here.

602
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:14,809
- I'm really feeling it.
- Yeah.

603
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:18,547
Now, I'm sorry, but our session
is coming to a close.

604
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,817
I guess I'll have to bill your widow.

605
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,487
Wow, that is cold-blooded,

606
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,709
but I got to hand it to you,
it's a pretty dope kill line.

607
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,546
Unfortunately, no one
will be billed, though.

608
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:27,654
Isn't that right, Charles?

609
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,624
- Hi, Dr. Tate!
- What? How did he...

610
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,571
Told you I could text
without looking at my phone.

611
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:33,568
Let's go.

612
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,504
Oh, man, I am so glad

613
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,094
you got my message with the location.

614
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,430
Pretty impressive, right?

615
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,766
Well, actually, you just texted

616
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:41,468
a bunch of crazy, weird, random letters.

617
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:42,971
It made me concerned,
so I tracked your phone.

618
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,940
Well, still pretty good.
I found you in my contacts.

619
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:46,339
It went to Amy. She forwarded it to me.

620
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,808
It worked. Let's stop talking about it.

621
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:48,993
Listen, I'm sorry.

622
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:50,431
I guess you were right
about the therapist.

623
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,568
Yeah, well, that's nice
of you to say, Charles,

624
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:55,738
but actually,
when I was stalling Dr. Tate,

625
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:57,908
I started talking
about my parents' divorce,

626
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:00,145
and it felt really good.

627
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:01,781
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but...

628
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:03,638
I think I'm gonna make
an appointment with a shrink.

629
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,587
Jake, that is so great.

630
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:07,662
And I know a guy who's really good.

631
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,832
You will love having him inside of you.

632
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,801
Okay.

633
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,694
What? Oh, come on, mister. Grow up.

634
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,765
Get your mind
out of the gutter, ya perv!

635
