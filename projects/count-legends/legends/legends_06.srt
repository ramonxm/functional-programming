1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:04,002
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,703
- The coffee guy was...
- Assaulting your head?

3
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:07,505
- What is going on up there?
- Is it bad?

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,400
Before I answer that question,
do you currently have a knife on you?

5
00:00:09,436 --> 00:00:10,672
- Yeah, several.
- Then I love it.

6
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:14,628
It really... is hair. It's bad, Rosa.

7
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:16,080
You look like Edna
from "The Incredibles."

8
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,049
I'm sorry, don't stab me.

9
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,616
My girlfriend Jocelyn's been practicing

10
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:19,916
a bunch of different hairstyles on me.

11
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:21,291
She's in cosmetology school.

12
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:24,032
- Is she... passing?
- Honestly, I don't know.

13
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:25,532
Well, let's get into this murder.

14
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,001
I'm hoping it's a dope one.

15
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,876
Mamma Mia. That's a bloody pizza pie.

16
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,012
No, it's okay.

17
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:34,280
I can say that. I'm half Italian.

18
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:35,542
That's not the problem I had with it.

19
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,951
Detectives. The vacuum was
running when we got here.

20
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,886
Smeared blood
across the entire apartment.

21
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:40,893
Is this dope enough for you?

22
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,054
I mean, it's a bloody robot, Rosa.

23
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,489
It's clearly a good start,
but it's gonna take

24
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,526
more than that to be certified as dope.

25
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:47,645
- Who's the Vic?
- Name is Andrew Adams.

26
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,033
- Kind of a boring name. Not dope.
- He's an investigative reporter.

27
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:51,854
- Dope. What was he investigating?
- Chicken farming.

28
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,191
Sharp turn away from dopeness,
but who found the body?

29
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:56,315
His boss called the cops
when he didn't show up to work,

30
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,651
so he was found by Officer Darrell.

31
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:00,545
Officer Darrell? You are
seriously undoping this.

32
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:02,566
You got anything else for me? Jen?

33
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:04,398
The apartment was
locked from the inside.

34
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:05,436
Mysterious. Dope.

35
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:06,971
And the alarm system was still armed.

36
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:08,341
Dope, dope, dope, dope.
So hard to solve.

37
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:09,804
- Any surveillance cameras?
- Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,307
- Tons of 'em. We checked 'em.
- It's too easy.

39
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:13,216
But no one was seen going in or out.

40
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:15,304
So whoever did this was a ghost.

41
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,484
Yes! A ghost!

42
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,200
Oh! I officially declare
this case... dope!

43
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:38,973
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

44
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:43,800
Whoo! I love the first
walkthrough of a crime scene.

45
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,241
It's kind of like arriving
at summer camp,

46
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:46,970
except the lake is full of blood

47
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:48,225
and your bunk mate is dead.

48
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:49,720
I think I might be bad at metaphors.

49
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:51,466
So after Adams comes home from work,

50
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:52,934
the only person who even approaches

51
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:54,175
his doorway is this delivery guy?

52
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,777
Yeah, but he never enters the apartment.

53
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:58,308
Hey, Rosa. Check it out. Triple digies!

54
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:00,448
There's so much evidence,
we hit triple digies.

55
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:02,251
- Cool.
- Cool indeed.

56
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:03,555
But you know what's not cool?

57
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:05,803
Our Vic ordered his dinner
from House of Lettuce.

58
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,860
There's no way this guy knew
he was gonna die.

59
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,691
No one would want lettuce
as their last meal.

60
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,594
For example, my last meal...

61
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,688
is gon'st to be Sour Straws.

62
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,152
- You just keep those in your pocket?
- We face death every day.

63
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,887
I gotta be prepared to go out
on my own terms.

64
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:19,071
I can't even think about eating.

65
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:21,041
Smells like the brim
of Scully's hat in here.

66
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:24,333
That's the heat wave.
It sped up body decomp.

67
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:25,741
I guess you could say this mystery

68
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,410
is straight outta decomp...

69
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,974
...ton.

70
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:31,680
- No. Who are you?
- I'm Franco McCoy.

71
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,355
I'm running CSI and forensics.

72
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:34,484
You two must be detectives.

73
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,090
I can tell because you look
pretty buttoned up.

74
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:37,422
We're both wearing leather jackets.

75
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,624
And I won this hoodie
for eating a big pizza.

76
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,658
Just do me a favor.

77
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,147
Don't turn into a star humper
around me or my squad,

78
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:44,626
because they make TV shows
about us sometimes.

79
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:46,422
What? They make shows
about us all the time.

80
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,587
- Name one.
- "Law and Order."

81
00:02:47,623 --> 00:02:48,706
- Never heard of it.
- "NYPD Blue."

82
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:49,499
- Nope.
- "Miami Vice."

83
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,389
- Nah.
- "Hill Street Blues."

84
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:51,195
- Pass.
- "The Wire."

85
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:52,363
- Sounds dumb.
- "Rizzoli & Isles."

86
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,296
Okay. That's a good one.

87
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:54,600
All right, if the heat
is causing the smell,

88
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:55,941
why don't we just turn on
the air conditioning...

89
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:57,578
Whoa, whoa, whoa! That kind of air flow

90
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:59,670
is gonna kick up
all kinds of dust particles.

91
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:01,830
That AC stays off,
which means the odor in here?

92
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:04,144
Only gonna get worse.
Pro tip: plug your noses.

93
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,434
Had this little bad boy
custom-made 3-D printed

94
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,998
to fit these sweet nosters.

95
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:09,901
Are you trying to abbreviate "nostrils"?

96
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:11,840
In CSI, we don't try.

97
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:15,123
We do, son.

98
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,002
Okay. Well, it's been
sort of okay meeting you.

99
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:20,647
We're gonna turn our backs
and ignore you now.

100
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,766
Hey, Jake. You know what it's time for?

101
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:25,733
I sure do.

102
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:27,768
Jake and Rosa's first impressions.

103
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:30,638
Cast-off pattern on the far wall
suggests upward knife slices. Jake?

104
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:33,333
Wounds on the vic's back means
he didn't see the killer coming. Rosa?

105
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:34,941
Laptop, wallet, keys all in plain sight.

106
00:03:34,977 --> 00:03:35,993
No sign of forced entry.

107
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,025
Doesn't connote a robbery. Jake?

108
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:38,261
But it does connote that our killer

109
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:39,652
was waiting for Adams in the apartment.

110
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:40,958
Did I just use the word
"connote" correctly?

111
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:41,894
- You did.
- Great.

112
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,846
Will you text that to Amy?

113
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:44,461
I don't want to say what using
good vocabulary gets me.

114
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:45,976
- Okay.
- Sexual intercourse.

115
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:47,721
- Gross.
- What? We're adults.

116
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:49,890
<i>I'm his mother! Let me in!</i>

117
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:52,508
Rock-paper-scissors for who
has to talk to the vic's mom.

118
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:53,390
Deal.

119
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:55,950
It's a game of chance.
How do you always win?

120
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,138
You always pick paper.

121
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:58,868
That is not true. Here, go again.

122
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:00,429
One more time.

123
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,026
All right, one more time.

124
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:03,590
One more time.

125
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,154
One more time.

126
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:06,528
One more time.

127
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,029
All right, one more time.

128
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,667
One more time.

129
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,533
God, this reverse psychology is a bust!

130
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:15,004
Ma'am? I'm Detective Peralta.

131
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,382
This is Detective Diaz.

132
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:17,718
I'm so sorry for your loss.

133
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:19,147
Please tell me whatever you can.

134
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:20,377
Nobody will tell me anything.

135
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:21,718
I really wish that I could,

136
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,187
but we're just starting
our investigation.

137
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:26,274
Now, is there anyone you can think of
that would want to hurt your son?

138
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,148
No! Everybody loved Andrew.

139
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,662
I don't know why this happened!

140
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,197
Please, you have to find who did this.

141
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:32,361
We're doing everything we can.

142
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,085
Promise me you'll find who did this.

143
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:35,974
- Ma'am, we can't promise...
- Promise me!

144
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:38,913
Andrew was my whole world.

145
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,824
I'm a single mom.

146
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:45,112
- I promise you.
<i>- Wow.</i>

147
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:46,546
You really are an idiot.

148
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:47,933
Um, exsqueeze me?

149
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,049
Did you really just promise

150
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:51,185
a victim's family member
we would solve a crime?

151
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,786
Oh, come on. I was just consoling her.

152
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:55,518
No. It was a full-on promise,
and it wasn't just her.

153
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:56,580
Yes, Betty.

154
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:58,949
I promise I will find
your friend's son's killer.

155
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:00,412
Yes, you can put your husband on.

156
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:01,495
I'll promise him too.

157
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,760
Okay, well, what's his number
at work, then?

158
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:04,846
Do you have a pen?

159
00:05:04,882 --> 00:05:06,321
You broke the number one rule

160
00:05:06,357 --> 00:05:07,827
of dealing with
a victim's family member.

161
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:09,790
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know.

162
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,549
She reminded me of my mom, okay?

163
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:12,986
A single mother crying in the hallway?

164
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:14,823
Those are some of my best
childhood memories.

165
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:15,949
- Jake.
- What, is that bad?

166
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,097
Dude, you never make a promise,

167
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,290
because if we don't solve this,

168
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:20,097
you've given her false hope,
and that is way worse.

169
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,729
Normally, I would totally
agree with you,

170
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:23,299
but we're going to solve this case.

171
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:25,689
We have so much evidence.
We hit triple digies!

172
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,814
We'll interview his friends
and neighbors and coworkers.

173
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,096
Come on. We got this!

174
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:31,003
- We're Jake and Rosa!
- And also Franco.

175
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,254
You're not a part of this, Franco.

176
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,215
Your loss.

177
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,284
_

178
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:37,831
My goodness.

179
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,579
Did Mother Gothel finally
let you out of the tower

180
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:41,372
to see the lanterns that fly
for your birthday?

181
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,984
- What?
- It was a "Tangled" burn.

182
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,552
Charles and I watched it for bros night.

183
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:46,092
Cool. No, Jocelyn's learning

184
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:47,720
how to weave in hair extensions.

185
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:48,703
She wanted me to look nice

186
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:49,798
'cause I'm meeting her parents tonight.

187
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,269
Wow. Moving fast.
Meetin' each other's parents.

188
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:54,038
Yeah. Well, I'm meeting hers.

189
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:55,950
I still haven't talked
to my mom since coming out,

190
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,221
so... it's kind of a bummer.

191
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,623
I don't really want to talk about this.
Can we find a segue?

192
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:02,259
What? You can't just say
"let's find a segue."

193
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,194
- I just did.
- Okay.

194
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,082
I talked to the neighbors.

195
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:05,703
Our Vic had a party three
nights before the murder.

196
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:07,077
I talked to everyone on the guest list.

197
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:08,862
They all have alibis, so I got nothing.

198
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,214
- How did your interviews go?
- Not great.

199
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,182
I talked to his coworkers,
friends, and family.

200
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,709
No one had a motive. Everyone loved him.
The dumb jerk. RIP.

201
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:17,037
Did you promise any of them
that you'd find the killer?

202
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:21,708
Yes, his aunt. She also reminded
me of my mom. Her name was Karen!

203
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:23,345
- Jake!
- Look, it's gonna be fine.

204
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:24,780
This apartment is full
of forensic evidence.

205
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:27,185
There is no way that CSI
hasn't found something.

206
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,252
I have never been more
confident in my entire...

207
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,855
I can taste the smell.

208
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,489
Ugh. You shouldn't be able
to taste smells.

209
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,243
That's the heat cookin' the blood rot

210
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,660
right out of the floorboards.

211
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,119
Set scent to simmer.

212
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,460
Serve over rice.

213
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,392
Well... I hated that.

214
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:42,672
Just so you know, Franco,

215
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,388
we're not responding positively
to you as a person.

216
00:06:44,424 --> 00:06:46,157
Yeah. Maybe just give us
an update on the labs.

217
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:48,247
Copy that. The victim
was stabbed 30 times.

218
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,405
Coroner puts time of death
between 6:00 p.m.

219
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:51,787
and 7:30 p.m. Sunday night.

220
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:53,552
Okay, and how many
DNA matches did you find?

221
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:54,754
- None.
- What about hair?

222
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,852
- Zero.
- Fingerprints?

223
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:57,957
Zilcharoni. I have
no matches of anything

224
00:06:57,993 --> 00:06:59,927
on any criminal databases whatsoever.

225
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:01,762
Still feeling good
about your promise, Jake?

226
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,620
Still feeling good
about that haircut, Cousin It?

227
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,365
Franco, how did you guys
not find anything?

228
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,766
You had 15 people in here.

229
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,010
First of all, you sound
so ignorant right now.

230
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:10,345
I had 14 guys here.

231
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:12,949
Like I'd ever get approval for 15 guys.
That's insane.

232
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:14,890
Second of all, don't worry,
Detective Kitty Cat.

233
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:16,875
I got one droplet of milk
nestled at the top

234
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,410
of CSI's teat, so pucker up.

235
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,729
Just talk normal.

236
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:22,094
We tested the blood.

237
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,854
This splatter here
belongs to the victim,

238
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:26,975
this to a second individual,

239
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,067
and that to a third.

240
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:29,236
Oh, hells, yes.

241
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:30,673
We might have some perp blood in here.

242
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:31,708
This is huge!

243
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,743
Rosa, we are gonna solve this case.

244
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:35,705
- What're you doing?
- Texting my mom.

245
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:36,780
I mean, the vic's mom.

246
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:38,418
I know that it's bad
that I said "my mom."

247
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:39,683
It's bad that you're texting her.

248
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:40,873
I know!

249
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:44,907
- _
- Ah. Good morning, Rosa.

250
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:46,819
I see you're still going out
with Edward Scissorhands.

251
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:48,638
You seem particularly
chipper this morning.

252
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,417
Indeed I am, because
I finally tracked down

253
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,184
the guy who delivered
our Vic his final meal

254
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,392
and, in so doing, maybe
saw the other two guys

255
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:55,611
who bled all over this apartment.

256
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,253
We don't know there were
three people in this apartment.

257
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,672
Peralta. Diaz. Special delivery.

258
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:00,983
Delivery guy.

259
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:02,382
Wow, Franco, you're really getting lazy.

260
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,762
- You're lazy.
- Even lazier.

261
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,698
Hello, sir. We'd like to ask
you a couple of questions.

262
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,648
Okay, look, I ate a couple fries out
of the bag, but everybody does that.

263
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:09,751
- That's not why you're here.
- Oh, snap.

264
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:11,484
- Is this about weed?
- Should it be?

265
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,827
No?

266
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,063
You delivered food to the guy
in this apartment at 6:40 p.m.

267
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,367
on Sunday, and within the hour,
he was murdered.

268
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:20,389
- What? How? That's horrible!
- Don't worry.

269
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,428
We're definitely gonna catch
the guy who did it, I promise.

270
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:23,998
- Stop promising people.
- Not.

271
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,907
Did you see anything suspicious?

272
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:27,640
No. But I didn't go inside.

273
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,243
The guy came to the door.
I just gave him the food.

274
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,824
And did you see or hear
anyone else in the apartment?

275
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,011
No, just that one guy.

276
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,935
He ordered, uh, three
beetroot zucchini wraps.

277
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,531
Three. Three disgusting wraps.

278
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,289
Three disgusting bloodstains. I knew it.

279
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:39,516
There were three people in there.

280
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,155
Will you be willing to
go inside and let us know

281
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:42,223
if anything looks different to you?

282
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,870
Yeah. Sure, that's fine. I don't care.

283
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:46,994
Why would you show this to me?

284
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,731
Oh, I'm too high to see this.
There's blood on the fish!

285
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:50,870
On the fish!

286
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:53,023
I always forget how weirdly numb

287
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,736
to horrific things we are.

288
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:55,897
Do you think it affects our souls

289
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,464
and the relationships
we build with others?

290
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,592
- Oh, for sure.
- Oh.

291
00:08:58,628 --> 00:08:59,727
You must have seen something.

292
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:01,001
You delivered the food at 6:40,

293
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:03,147
and sometime before 7:30,
Adams was stabbed to death.

294
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:04,449
Stop saying "stabbed"!

295
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,280
What I saw in there forever changed me.

296
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:07,796
My heart is still pounding.

297
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:08,883
Wait.

298
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:10,384
Adams was wearing a smart watch, right?

299
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,552
Those things track your heart rate.

300
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:12,988
If we look at his phone, we can see

301
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:14,873
the exact moment that his heart
stopped beating.

302
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,265
Here we go. Activities app.

303
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,762
And... boom.

304
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:20,681
His heart rate dropped to zero
at exactly 6:03.

305
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:23,266
The food wasn't even ordered
until 6:16, which means...

306
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:24,902
The killer ordered the food!

307
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,496
Oh, God. Did I talk to a murderer?

308
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,644
Jake, this guy saw the perp.

309
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,113
We have to get him in
front of a sketch artist.

310
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,904
Oh, yeah. I'm feeling it now, Rosa.

311
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,774
At this time tomorrow, we're gonna know

312
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:34,509
exactly what our killer looks like.

313
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,678
We have no idea what
our killer looks like.

314
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:38,013
Well, that's not totally true.

315
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:39,748
We now know that the
killer might look like

316
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:42,391
Seth Myers, Winona Ryder,
or Bilbo Baggins.

317
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:43,884
The delivery guy kept starting over.

318
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,379
Apparently, he's always high.
I'm sorry, man.

319
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:47,609
Our big break turned into nothing.

320
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,256
- Detectives.
- Ah! Captain.

321
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:50,525
Did you come down here to take a look

322
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,554
at the two best detectives
you've ever worked with in action?

323
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,243
The two best detectives
I've ever worked with

324
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,413
are Montez and Dillman.

325
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,480
- Oh. You never mentioned them before.
- They were excellent.

326
00:09:57,516 --> 00:09:59,505
I'm here because Major Crimes
wants this case.

327
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,007
I was hoping to tell them
you have some leads.

328
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:04,462
I overheard you mention
a Bill Bo-Baggins.

329
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:05,453
Should we bring him in?

330
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:06,740
Well, as much as I would
love to meet him,

331
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:07,739
he is not a suspect.

332
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,707
- Okay, so who is?
- At this time? No one.

333
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,014
But... we are currently
investigating no leads.

334
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,246
- So you have nothing.
- Not nothing.

335
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,050
Jake made a new best friend.
The vic's mom.

336
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:18,553
He promised her he'd solve the case.

337
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:19,660
- That's a rookie mistake.
- Okay.

338
00:10:19,696 --> 00:10:22,355
Fine. So maybe I'm not
Montana and Dilbert.

339
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:23,578
Montez and Dillman!

340
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:25,859
And they would've remembered
your name after one mention.

341
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:27,968
Because we're memorable,
and they're not.

342
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:28,874
Turned it around.

343
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,911
- Nope.
- All right, look, Captain.

344
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:31,514
Rosa and I are gonna solve this case.

345
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,540
The answer is in this room.
We just have to focus

346
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:35,609
and let the room speak to us,
isn't that right, room?

347
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:38,227
When you talk to the room,
I lose even more confidence in you.

348
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,048
Why? Oh, wait, I see it. All right.

349
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:41,892
Can you please just buy us
some more time anyway?

350
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:43,594
Sir, I feel like we've earned this.

351
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,949
- Fine. Work fast.
- You got it.

352
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:47,915
Okay. Let's look at the scene
like we're seeing it

353
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,216
for the first time with fresh eyes.

354
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:50,217
Vic was face down.

355
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:51,886
Cast-off splatter suggests
upward knife slices.

356
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,087
No signs of forced entry.

357
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:54,789
Laptop, wallet, keys were all there.

358
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:56,156
Doesn't connote a robbery.

359
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:57,783
Wait a minute.
Have we said this already?

360
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,026
Are we just having the exact
same conversation?

361
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:00,177
- Yep.
- Cool. Moving on.

362
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,194
Windows and doors locked
from the inside.

363
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,664
Nobody in or out.

364
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:06,181
Think, think, think... oh!

365
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:08,117
The upstairs neighbor
and his best friend

366
00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:09,987
drilled through the ceiling,
murdered Adams,

367
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:12,356
bleed all over the apartment,
then climbed back up

368
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:13,768
and sealed the hole behind them!

369
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:15,371
Negative, we would have
found construction debris

370
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:16,874
and microscopic paint fibers.

371
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,576
The only thing that needs patching...

372
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:20,082
is that theory.

373
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,384
Okay. New idea.

374
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,433
We're gonna get inside
the mind of the killer.

375
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:25,874
We eat the veggie wraps.

376
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,031
Here we go.

377
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,274
Oh, this sick bastard.

378
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:33,643
Oh, man. This is one twisted mother.

379
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,278
Oh, the beets are raw.

380
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,146
This guy is demented, Rosa!

381
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:38,970
Okay. All we have to do is figure out

382
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:41,005
what kind of person can walk
by cameras without being seen.

383
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,718
- Someone camouflaged as a wall.
- Unlikely.

384
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:44,019
Harry Potter and his invisibility cloak.

385
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:45,242
- Not a real person.
- Babadook.

386
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,519
- Doesn't exist.
- What about a Looper situation?

387
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:48,437
- It's not a Looper situation.
- It could totally be a Looper situation!

388
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,296
- It's not a Looper situation.
- This is my least favorite hair!

389
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,926
Oh, my God, Rosa, come here.

390
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:55,159
Look at the blood spatter.

391
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,129
- Do you see what I see?
- Uh, blood.

392
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,787
In the exact shape
of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

393
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:02,900
Pec, pec, delt, delt. Big Samoan tattoo.

394
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:05,223
Rosa. I think I just made a connection.

395
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,199
The number three is everywhere.

396
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:09,102
Three people. Three types of blood.

397
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:12,151
And guess what the tax was
on the veggie wraps?

398
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,001
Three dollars.

399
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:17,771
And 19¢, but if you ignore
the 19, then it's three!

400
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,850
- Okay. You've lost your mind.
- What? Who told you that?

401
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,639
- Was it room?
- No. It's the fact that you think

402
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,180
the room has a voice and also
you're working in your boxers!

403
00:12:24,216 --> 00:12:26,917
To beat the heat, Rosa!
To beat the heat!

404
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:28,283
If we can't turn on the AC,

405
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:29,689
that's not crazy, it's just smart.

406
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:31,726
Jake. I gave the case to Major Crimes.

407
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:34,423
What? You can't do that.
I promised Luan!

408
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:35,959
Yeah, and now you can't let it go.

409
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,239
The scene's yours, guys.

410
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,639
I'm sorry, Jake. It's over.

411
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,775
Okay, Rosa, fine! I'll leave.

412
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:42,781
Come on, room!

413
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:47,677
- You left your pants.
- I don't care!

414
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:51,603
- Hey, Jake.
- Ah!

415
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,228
Hello, Rosa, my coworker and friend.

416
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:54,530
Look, I know you're mad at me,

417
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,865
but I only gave away
that case to help you.

418
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,022
You were acting like a lunatic.

419
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,162
Don't even worry about it.
You were totally right.

420
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:01,429
I was in way too deep, and honestly,

421
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,215
I feel so free not having to work

422
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,494
that case anymore, so thank you.

423
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,658
Cool, you're welcome.
What's up with all the ketchup?

424
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:09,227
Thank you for asking, Rosa.

425
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,369
It's for my hot dog.

426
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,839
Anyways, this has been a great chat,

427
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,708
but I better get back to my hot dog.

428
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:19,134
- Oh, wow.
- Ah! Hey!

429
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,470
Rosa, guess what?

430
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:22,039
There was no hot dog.

431
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:23,475
Who's the lunatic now?

432
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,605
- Still you, Jake.
- Yeah, right!

433
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,681
There's nothing crazy
about this, sister.

434
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:29,289
It's the crime scene:
stove, kitchen island,

435
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,526
blood, and of course, the body.

436
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,357
Hi, Rosa. I'm the body.

437
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:34,684
Shh. Stay in character!

438
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,753
- Roger that.
- Let's get that blood on you.

439
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:38,725
You gave away my case, but guess what?

440
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,095
I spent two months in that apartment.

441
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:41,497
I can recreate it in my sleep.

442
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,560
- Have you slept?
- No.

443
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,385
What the hell is going on in here?

444
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:45,897
Jake's gone insane because he promised

445
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:47,856
the victim's mom he'd
solve her son's murder.

446
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:50,683
Seriously? You never promise
a victim's relative anything.

447
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,785
Oh, please. Classic Terry.

448
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:54,655
Mr. Emotionless. Sgt. Cold Heart.

449
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:55,890
The man who bleeds ice.

450
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,159
I don't think that rings true.

451
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,461
- No?
- Clean it up and get out.

452
00:13:58,497 --> 00:13:59,497
You've lost your mind.

453
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:00,666
What? That's not true!

454
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:01,775
Charles, tell him.

455
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:03,044
Well, actually, he does have a point.

456
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,387
Really? Oh, man, wow.

457
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:07,556
I guess it really does take
your closest friends

458
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:10,134
to make you realize
that you have crap friends

459
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,244
that are idiots and are dumb and idiots!

460
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,448
I'm solving this.

461
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:17,119
Hey, we heard there's a hot dog in here.

462
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,654
No. Jake lied for no reason.

463
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,173
That son of a bitch!

464
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,810
_

465
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,034
Oh, hey, babe.

466
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,744
Ugh! It's me, Jake!

467
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,913
I'm just working!
What is wrong with you?

468
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,469
What are you doing?
Why do you have a knife?

469
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,305
Why am I covered in red Post-its?

470
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,208
That's blood. You're the corpse.

471
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:36,677
Jake, who is that?

472
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,234
Franco McCoy. CSI.

473
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,373
He's helping me with the case.

474
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:40,974
For the record, I think it's
weird that I'm here too.

475
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,441
Both of you, get out!

476
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:44,589
Yeah, sounds good. Sorry to wake you.

477
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,960
Sweet dreams. Come on.

478
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,562
_

479
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:50,566
Okay, so, no one went in,
no one came out.

480
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:52,103
The lab confirmed
that the surveillance footage

481
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:53,243
wasn't tampered with.

482
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:56,159
So what happened in there, Olive Rosa?

483
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,895
- I don't know.
- Ah! You can talk.

484
00:14:58,102 --> 00:14:59,533
Oh. Rosa.

485
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:00,774
It's just you.

486
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,532
I thought I was really going
crazy for a second there.

487
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,660
It was just person Rosa.

488
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,163
You look like crap.

489
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:07,880
You look like a freshman
at an all-women's college.

490
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,874
I don't think you're in a position
to be offering criticism right now.

491
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,897
More than fair.

492
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,307
I'm worried about you, man.

493
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:15,671
Yeah. I can't figure it out.

494
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,340
- Then you gotta let it go.
- I can't do that either.

495
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,010
Look, I know you want
to help this woman,

496
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,312
but there are other cases.

497
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:21,647
There are other people
that need your help,

498
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:23,038
and right now,
you're not helping anyone.

499
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:25,592
You gotta tell her it's over.

500
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:27,236
I don't know if I can do that.

501
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,157
Then I'll go with you.

502
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:31,491
I forced you to be there
when I came out to my parents.

503
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,078
I owe you.

504
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,168
All right.

505
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,455
<i>We've exhausted every lead,</i>

506
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:41,445
we have checked every alibi,

507
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,999
and we have followed
every last piece of forensics,

508
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:47,045
so I guess what I'm trying to say is...

509
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:52,657
I can't find your son's killer.

510
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:55,395
I understand.

511
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:57,231
Thank you for trying as hard as you did.

512
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,767
I really hoped you'd find him.

513
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:01,321
Well, don't lose hope,
because Major Crimes

514
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:03,359
is on the case as we speak,
and they're very...

515
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,761
Oh, they already contacted me.

516
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,953
Because it's been so long
without any new leads,

517
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,594
they've labeled it a cold case.

518
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,997
They said I shouldn't hold out hope.

519
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:13,237
I'm sorry.

520
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,073
It's not you.

521
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:18,474
I just can't stop feeling guilty.

522
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,110
Andrew and I were not
on the best of terms.

523
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:22,512
We had this huge fight,

524
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,884
and we hadn't spoken in almost a year.

525
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,465
I just wish I could've made it
right when I had the chance.

526
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,574
I'm very sorry to hear that,
but I'm sure...

527
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,819
- We're gonna find your son's killer.
- What?

528
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:34,345
Jake and I are jumping back on the case.

529
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,730
We'll make sure your son
gets the justice he deserves.

530
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:38,533
I promise.

531
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,296
Thank you.

532
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:47,639
Rosa?

533
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,006
She just reminds me of my mom.

534
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,016
Oh, boy.

535
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:54,425
_

536
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:56,931
So, we gonna talk about
what happened back there?

537
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,373
I haven't seen someone cry that much

538
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:00,534
since Charles heard they were
remaking "First Wives Club."

539
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:03,250
It sort of bothers me that my mom
hasn't talked to me since I came out.

540
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,520
Why don't you just give her a call?

541
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,588
Because I shouldn't have to.

542
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:07,222
It's her issue, not mine.

543
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:08,954
I mean, I'm glad I came out
to her, it's just,

544
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,082
it's taking her way longer to come
around than I thought it would.

545
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,403
It sucks.

546
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,465
That's weird.
The police tape's already gone.

547
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,493
Oh, yeah, Major Crimes
released the scene yesterday.

548
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:17,928
But I'm sure they haven't had time

549
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:20,268
to clean up the evidence...

550
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,632
Oh, man, they emptied the place out.

551
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,834
Nothing left in here.

552
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,209
I can't believe this is how it ends.

553
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,631
Yeah. Is it weird that I miss the smell?

554
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,461
Wait a minute, do you hear that?

555
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:32,958
I've spent 600 hours in this room,

556
00:17:32,994 --> 00:17:34,226
and I have never heard that sound.

557
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,429
It's because the air conditioning's

558
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:36,631
never been turned on.

559
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,400
It's coming from that vent.

560
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,807
I don't see anything.

561
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:44,041
Wait, there's a bend.

562
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:47,778
Oh, my God.

563
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:50,177
There's food and water in here!

564
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:53,265
Rosa. We never saw the killer
leave this apartment

565
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:54,488
because he never left.

566
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,318
But he couldn't have survived in
there for months. That's insane.

567
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:57,458
He wasn't back there for months.

568
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,057
He just waited for the body
to be discovered

569
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:00,660
and then snuck out sometime after that.

570
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:01,829
But this place was crawling with cops.

571
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:02,964
Which is exactly what he wanted.

572
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,506
He snuck out dressed like a cop.

573
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,689
Even if he had a uniform,
somebody would've recognized him.

574
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:08,623
- Not if his face was covered.
- By a Hazmat suit.

575
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:09,795
The CSI guys!

576
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,147
Franco said he had 14 techs,
but didn't you count 15?

577
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,184
I did count 15! My math was right!

578
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,929
Suck it, Mrs. Skanga!

579
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:17,509
She was my Algebra II teacher.

580
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,053
She threw a protractor at my head.

581
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,320
- She sucks.
- She sucked!

582
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:22,052
Actually, she was very sweet.
She believed in me.

583
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:23,188
- Oh.
- Yeah.

584
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:25,520
Here's the security footage.

585
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:27,856
It's rated G for Gonna Get Got.

586
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:29,791
Less is more, Franco. Play the tape.

587
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,763
Okay, so there's us arriving.

588
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,921
Oh, man, is that how I walk?

589
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:35,258
- Yes.
- Should I change how I walk?

590
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:37,117
- Yes.
- All right. Wait. Go back.

591
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:38,619
Jake, we don't have time
to fix your walk.

592
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:40,155
It's gonna take a lot of work,
and we're very busy.

593
00:18:40,191 --> 00:18:41,790
No. Look. Look at this guy.

594
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:43,965
All the other techs are wearing
booties, but he's not.

595
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,096
Follow that guy.

596
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,795
Where's the footage from
the bodega across the street?

597
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:53,225
We have that? That is so crazy.

598
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,929
We are under surveillance at all times.

599
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:57,256
I'm sure it's fine and it won't
backfire and ruin society.

600
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:58,550
Zoom in on his face.

601
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:01,027
That man's not CSI.

602
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:02,139
No, Franco.

603
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,079
But he is about to say...

604
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:05,648
CS-Bye.

605
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,995
Yeah-ow!

606
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:10,697
Respect, Jake. Respect.

607
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,788
<i>Okay, Rosa.</i>

608
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:16,190
- You know what it's time for.
- I do.

609
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:17,944
Jake and Rosa's final impressions.

610
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,012
Your client's a hit man.

611
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:21,376
He snuck into the apartment
during a party several nights earlier,

612
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:24,379
hid in the vent for three days, then
emerged and murdered Adams. Jake?

613
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:25,801
He then spilled bags of blood

614
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:27,683
that he stole from a blood bank
all over the floor

615
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,286
and turned on
the victim's vacuum cleaner

616
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:31,328
to make the crime scene
as messy as possible. Rosa?

617
00:19:31,364 --> 00:19:33,064
The messy scene meant
there'd be extra crime techs,

618
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,319
allowing your client
to sneak out in a Hazmat suit,

619
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:36,566
which records show he bought online.

620
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:38,102
Two weeks before the crime
was committed.

621
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:39,456
My only question is,

622
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,809
who was behind all this?

623
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,166
I was hired by a chicken farmer.

624
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:44,899
Okay. Dopeness taking a late hit here,
but we still got you.

625
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,863
See you at the sentencing,
peace, and we're out.

626
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:49,187
He's pleading guilty.

627
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:50,524
Oh, thank God.

628
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,172
But why did he kill Andrew?

629
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,727
- Was he doing something bad?
- Not at all.

630
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:57,810
He was about to publish an exposé
on a large-scale poultry farm

631
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,605
whose owner was bribing
an FDA regulator.

632
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:00,908
He put a hit out on your son.

633
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:02,378
Well, is anybody going after him?

634
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,781
If they're not, then I will.
I promise you.

635
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,418
- Come here.
- Oh.

636
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,423
Why are you promising her?

637
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,135
I can't help myself!

638
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,311
Good-bye, detectives.

639
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,004
Take care.

640
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:19,631
I gotta say, we would not
have solved that case

641
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,433
if you hadn't gotten
involved emotionally.

642
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:23,288
Think we'd be better cops
if we did that all the time?

643
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:25,297
- Absolutely not, never again.
- Yeah, it was a total nightmare.

644
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,345
You want to get a celebratory drink?

645
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:27,848
I would, but I'm actually
meeting somebody.

646
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:29,594
Is it Jocelyn? Do I get to meet Jocelyn?

647
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,948
Oh, God, is she gonna try
and cut my hair?

648
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,028
No. It's my mom.

649
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,363
I waited too long for her to come around

650
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,145
and call me, so I called her.

651
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:36,707
That is so great.

652
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:38,650
Oh, no. Is she meeting you here?

653
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,084
Am I about to get caught in the middle

654
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,148
of all your weird awkwardness again?

655
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:44,152
- Hello, Jake.
- Ah! Hello, Mrs. Diaz!

656
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,983
America's favorite mother!

657
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,147
So?

658
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:53,675
So.

659
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,894
So...

660
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:55,971
Rosa's bi.

661
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,151
Yes, Jake, I remember.

662
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:58,787
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool...

663
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,431
- You don't have to stay, man.
- Great. Thanks.

664
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:03,721
It's really good to see you, Rosalita.

665
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,220
It's good to see you too.

666
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:09,681
- What did you do to your hair?
- Mom!

667
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,082
No, no, no, it's very cute, <i>mija</i>.

668
