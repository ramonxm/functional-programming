1
00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:01,986
Sir, you wanted to see me?

2
00:00:02,022 --> 00:00:03,328
Yes, I have an assignment for you.

3
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:04,721
I'm afraid it's not a pleasant one.

4
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:06,605
Oh, my God. Please tell me it's not...

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,041
Yes, it's Hitchcock related.

6
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,375
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,077
Detective Hitchcock is set to testify

8
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,285
in court this afternoon.

9
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,479
It's an important case,

10
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,348
and I'd rather not get
another call from the DA

11
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,423
saying he showed up
"covered in condiments."

12
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:20,999
So you want me to keep Hitchcock

13
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:23,313
from spilling on himself
for the rest of the day?

14
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:24,759
We both know that's impossible.

15
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:26,284
- I'm counting on you.
- I won't do it.

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,784
- There's nobody else I trust.
- What you're asking is insane.

17
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,279
- I'm not asking.
- It's a suicide mission!

18
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:33,179
- Then prepare for death.
- You've lost your mind!

19
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:35,582
This is a direct order, Detective!
Get in line!

20
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,508
Hey. You guys startled Hitchcock.

21
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:39,972
He spilled two full jars
of spaghetti sauce on himself.

22
00:00:40,348 --> 00:00:41,814
Thanks a lot, fellas.

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,550

24
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,343
Ames, super important question.

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,946
Which one of these shirts
should I wear to dinner

26
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,728
- with your mom tonight?
- Those are exactly the same.

27
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:09,263
I have a signature look, Rosa.

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,948
Put on a T-shirt for all I care.

29
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,235
It doesn't matter what you wear.

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,503
Of course it matters.

31
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,005
He has to wear the smaller checks.

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,607
Big checks wash him out.
Where are you, Amy?

33
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:20,010
It doesn't matter, because
the night is already ruined.

34
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:21,311
My stupid mother invited

35
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:23,179
my stupid brother David to join us.

36
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:24,247
I thought you liked your brothers.

37
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:25,581
I have seven brothers, Rosa,

38
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:27,617
and I like all of them except David.

39
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:28,908
Perfect David.

40
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:30,202
David graduated at the top of his class

41
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:31,538
at the police academy.

42
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:32,872
David took a bullet for the mayor.

43
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:34,373
David bakes his own bread.

44
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:36,275
Ooh, and does this David have a sister?

45
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,859
- Yes. Amy is his sister.
- And what's her deal?

46
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:40,161
You were at the wedding, Hitchcock.

47
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:41,796
I'm just gonna call and cancel.

48
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:42,964
I really don't want
to have dinner with my mom

49
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,585
fawning all over the golden boy.

50
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:45,975
I'm sure your mom
loves you both equally.

51
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:47,092
No, she definitely doesn't.

52
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:48,775
My parents arrange
the photos of their kids

53
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:50,038
by who makes them the proudest.

54
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:51,940
Number one goes on the mantel
above the fireplace,

55
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:53,474
two through four on the piano,
and the rest

56
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,076
- are on the staircase.
- This is wack.

57
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,711
- So David's on the mantel?
- Always.

58
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:58,766
Meanwhile, my picture
gathers dust on the piano.

59
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:01,514
- The piano's not that bad.
- Nobody in the family even plays, Rosa.

60
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,884
At least people use the stairs.

61
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,853
All right, David is perfect,
but so are you.

62
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:06,654
Let's just go tonight,
and I'll be your hype man.

63
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,456
You know how good I am
at talking you up.

64
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:09,690
Here, watch. Hey, Scully.

65
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,060
Did you know that Amy is super cool?

66
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:14,528
No way. Can I get your autograph, ma'am?

67
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:16,264
- See?
- Fine, we'll go.

68
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,198
What, too stuck up for your fans?

69
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,644
Ya friggin' turd!

70
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,268
Hey, Captain, Sarge,

71
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:22,636
I have a case I want to discuss
with you.

72
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,045
You want to talk about work
in the break room?

73
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,123
That's highly unorthodox, but
I suppose we can give it a try.

74
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,026
Okay, so I have a perp...

75
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,061
I'm sorry, this is insane.
Let's talk in my office.

76
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:32,833
Much better. All right, Boyle,

77
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,197
what's this case
you wanted to talk about?

78
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:36,066
I have a perp, Alfonso Tucker,

79
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:37,500
transferring into our holding cell.

80
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:39,901
The guy who was dealing
that toxic batch of meth?

81
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:41,904
Yeah, and he refuses
to name his supplier.

82
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,248
I want to send someone into holding,

83
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:45,777
undercover as a perp, to see
if they can get him to open up.

84
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:46,976
Why don't you do it?

85
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,745
You're always going on
about your acting abilities

86
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,276
and that time you played Annie.

87
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:53,350
I'm an adult man, Sarge.
I didn't play Annie.

88
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:56,142
I was in "Annie."
I played Miss Hannigan.

89
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:58,754
Unfortunately, Alfonso knows I'm a cop,

90
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,058
so I can't be Maxwell Blaze.

91
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,093
But Terry might be right for the role.

92
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,561
Ooh, that sounds fun.

93
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:08,245
I love flexing my creative muscles.

94
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:10,482
In addition to flexing
my actual muscles.

95
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:13,516
- Or I could do it.
- What? You hate theater.

96
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,024
You always say acting
is just professional lying.

97
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,822
Yes, but this is
what the mission calls for,

98
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:19,490
and I'm good at it.

99
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:20,909
Kevin and I went to a dinner party

100
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:24,107
where we played the French
parlor game "charades."

101
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,781
I had to act out Elvis Presley.

102
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,183
He's dead now,
so I portrayed him as such.

103
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,418
Everyone understood...

104
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:33,553
Immediately.

105
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,856
You know, a little competition

106
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:36,324
might bring out the best in both of you.

107
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,993
We'll hold auditions this afternoon.

108
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:39,270
I'll prepare sides.

109
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:41,626
Please wear clothes you can move in.

110
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,165
Okay, let's get to the table
before David gets here.

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,932
My mother loves an early bird.

112
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,535
Hey, babe, before we go in,

113
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,604
I know I said I was gonna do
the whole hype man thing, but...

114
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,615
I know.

115
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:53,840
I shouldn't compare myself
to my brother.

116
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,074
We're all on our own journey.

117
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,543
What? No. Who told you that garbage?

118
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:57,711
I was gonna say, we need a backup plan

119
00:03:57,746 --> 00:03:59,045
so you can win this thing.

120
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,480
If it starts slipping away,
I'll pretend to choke,

121
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:01,681
and then you give me the Heimlich

122
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,349
and save my life in front of everyone.

123
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,719
Aw, thanks for not trying
to make me a better person.

124
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,338
- I love you.
- Love you too.

125
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:09,241
Amy, Jake!

126
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:12,926
David and I both arrived an hour early.

127
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,430
We're sharing a French onion.

128
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,255
Mother...

129
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:18,180
So she's about to jump, and I say,

130
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,550
"Hey, I can't tell you
this world is a good place,

131
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:23,041
but I guarantee you
it's better with you in it."

132
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:24,509
And she climbs down off the ledge,

133
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:25,953
- and she gives me a big hug.
- Ugh.

134
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,489
And that was before she won the Oscar?

135
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:29,091
I don't know, I don't
really follow pop culture.

136
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:31,293
You never cease to impress me, David.

137
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:32,695
Hey, speaking of impressive,

138
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,262
Amy just went to the NYPD shooting range

139
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:36,622
and received a gold
certification in marksmanship.

140
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:38,300
Oh, I just got
the platinum certification.

141
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,936
What? That exists? What did you do,
curve the bullets, "Wanted"-style?

142
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:43,338
Yeah, I don't know what "Wanted" is.
I don't follow pop culture.

143
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,607
But I fired ten shots, and they
all went into the same hole.

144
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:47,342
Oh, so you actually did.

145
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,040
Hey, Camila, did you know that Amy

146
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,409
is the youngest female sergeant

147
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:51,644
in the history of the Nine-Nine?

148
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,314
Yes, I'm very proud of her.

149
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,682
I'm proud of all my children.

150
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:56,251
The sergeant and the lieutenant.

151
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,786
What? You passed the lieutenant's exam?

152
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:00,803
It actually wasn't something
I was planning on taking,

153
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,838
but then my partner got sick
and I wanted to be able

154
00:05:02,874 --> 00:05:04,340
to send home extra money
to his wife and kids.

155
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:07,077
Then I read the MRI.
He was totally misdiagnosed.

156
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,213
So long story short, Bo is alive,

157
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:11,315
and I got a perfect score
on the test for no reason.

158
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,251
Oh, man.

159
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:14,317
Hey, check out these dinner rolls, huh?

160
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:15,645
Love these bad boys.

161
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,040
I'm just gonna chomp down on that,

162
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:18,271
recklessly.

163
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,733
Oh! Oh, no, Jake! He's choking!

164
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,477
Let David do it. He has EMT training.

165
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:26,580
- I'm here for you, Jake.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

166
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:27,981
You know what...

167
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,383
Don't worry. It is gonna hurt like hell.

168
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:30,839
I think it's actually okay.

169
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:35,422
Thank you both so much for coming in.

170
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:37,189
This is a safe space

171
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,436
where choices are welcome.

172
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:40,861
Okay, now, I trust that both of you

173
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,463
had a chance to review the script?

174
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,570
- Yeah.
- Good. Now throw them away!

175
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,815
What the hell?
I wrote notes in the margin.

176
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,283
Terry found his super-objective.

177
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,721
I want to see you improvise
without the safety net.

178
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:54,657
I want to see you become Maxwell Blaze.

179
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:58,060
So, Maxwell, what was
your childhood like?

180
00:05:58,095 --> 00:05:59,541
I was a lookout at 8,

181
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:01,196
had my own corner at 10,

182
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:02,732
trigger man at 13.

183
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:05,768
You know what it's like
to look a man in his eyes

184
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,402
as the life drains out of him?

185
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:09,503
I was bad from a young age.

186
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,140
At school, I pushed people.

187
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:14,810
And this wasn't horseplay.
This was pushing to hurt.

188
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:16,345
Do you have a girlfriend at home?

189
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,314
Used to. She got tired
of me getting locked up.

190
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:19,962
She's with my brother now.

191
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:22,200
He better hope I never find his ass.

192
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:25,370
I do, and you should see her heavy,

193
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:26,805
feminine breasts,

194
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,440
with their perfectly placed nipples.

195
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,075
Don't get me started on her can.

196
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,610
- What's your greatest fear?
- I ain't scared of nothing.

197
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:34,378
My girlfriend.
I'm scared she'll find out

198
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:35,776
about my mistress,

199
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:38,349
who also has a perfect can.

200
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:41,017
It's smaller, but it's harder.

201
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:42,086
Great.

202
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,522
You both have given me
something totally different.

203
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:46,692
I've got a lot to think about.

204
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,990
Thank you. Next!

205
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:51,229
What up, dawgs?

206
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,847
Norm Scully, reading for Maxwell Blaze.

207
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:56,717
Listen, I just did what anyone would do.

208
00:06:57,202 --> 00:06:58,868
Hey, where'd you go?

209
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:01,037
I just couldn't stand there
while the whole restaurant

210
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,739
gushed over David saving your life.

211
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,141
Yeah, there was a standing ovation.

212
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:06,676
Also, everyone saw you
walk away while I was choking,

213
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:07,977
and I don't want to say
you're a villain now,

214
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,247
but the B-word was tossed around a lot.

215
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:11,814
Ugh. I'm sorry.

216
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,250
I just can't be around him.

217
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:14,951
- I shouldn't have come.
- So let's leave.

218
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:16,886
I'll tell everyone my stomach
hurts, which it does.

219
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,821
I'm pretty sure he broke my rib
when he gave me the Heimlich.

220
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,199
Lieutenant Santiago, a word?

221
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,589
Why is David's captain here?

222
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,611
What's going on?
Is there a maniac on the loose,

223
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:26,947
and David's the only one
who can catch him

224
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,216
before he blows up a train?

225
00:07:28,252 --> 00:07:29,785
Oh, we could call him the Trainiac.

226
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,517
We're focused on the same things.

227
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,419
Sorry, folks, we've
discovered a large quantity

228
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,021
of cocaine in Lieutenant
Santiago's desk.

229
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,616
We've had to place him under arrest.

230
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:43,595
Oh, no.

231
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,483
Of course. We'll head over soon.

232
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,123
So that was my brother.

233
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,815
He needs me to bail him out of jail.

234
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:52,916
I feel so awful for him.

235
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,251
You are smiling so much.

236
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,487
No, no, I promise. I feel so, so, bad.

237
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:57,376
Rosa D!

238
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:58,889
- Deezer, what up?
- Deezer?

239
00:07:58,924 --> 00:08:00,824
Hey, Scully, did you do
something new with your hair?

240
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,493
Same thing as always: put mousse in it

241
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:04,395
while it's wet,
then I watch a scary movie.

242
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,597
- You the man.
- What is wrong with her?

243
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:08,332
Her brother David got arrested.

244
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,334
- He's a cokehead!
- And you're happy about this?

245
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,852
That's savage. I love it.

246
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,518
- I'm not happy about it!
- All right.

247
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:14,854
Calm down, Littlefinger.

248
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,174
He's in a lot of trouble, you know.

249
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,808
Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right.

250
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:19,610
It's a terrible situation.

251
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,446
- Let's go bail him out.
- All right.

252
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,614
Ooh, should I get my hair
blown out first?

253
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,173
I'm gonna have pictures from
today for the rest of my life.

254
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,252
Are you... a bad person?

255
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:31,489
Casting's up!

256
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,123
This is not a high school play, Boyle.

257
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:34,124
Just let us know who you went with.

258
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,158
Okay, first of all,

259
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:36,760
I want to say that this was

260
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:38,829
one of the hardest decisions
I've ever had to make.

261
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:40,931
There is so much talent in this room.

262
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:42,142
Just tell us, bitch.

263
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:43,701
Act as if you already have the role.

264
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:46,036
I could have cast any one of you

265
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,652
and put on a great show,

266
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:49,039
but I had to make a call.

267
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:50,808
Enough, Boyle. We're all adults.

268
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:52,610
No one cares about this that much.

269
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,144
- It's Captain Holt.
- Captain Holt?

270
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:55,479
He was the worst one!

271
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:58,215
No offense, but Holt
was so unconvincing.

272
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,617
He kept referring to his childhood

273
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:01,351
as a soot-covered street urchin.

274
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:04,154
Yes, I gave myself
a Dickensian backstory,

275
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:06,760
which apparently
made quite the impression.

276
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,958
I'm sorry, Sarge.

277
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:10,893
Honestly, I don't think
I'm the right director

278
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:14,030
to bring your vision
of Maxwell Blaze to life.

279
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:15,465
What does that even mean?

280
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,733
It means you blew it.

281
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,989
Walk away, Jeffords. Walk away.

282
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:22,239
Okay, this is gonna be my mantel shot.

283
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:23,640
So every time Mom and Dad look at it,

284
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:25,175
they'll be reminded of what David did.

285
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,843
I would say you should chill out,

286
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:28,178
but this is actually
making me feel great

287
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:29,912
about my family, so let's dive in.

288
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,915
Everybody say "possession
with intent to distribute"!

289
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:34,151
Hey.

290
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:35,908
- Oh!
- Ah, David, hi there.

291
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:37,354
That was unrelated to your recent arrest

292
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:38,721
for possession
with intent to distribute.

293
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:40,257
- How are you?
- Not great.

294
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,691
Yeah, jail is rough.

295
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:43,160
You got to go poop in front of everyone.

296
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,694
I remember when I was in prison,

297
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,228
I held it for weeks,
and when I finally did go,

298
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:47,563
it was...

299
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,365
You know what, Jake?
This isn't about you.

300
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,267
So, David, did you get fired,

301
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:53,035
or is there gonna be, like, a hearing?

302
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,337
She's asking so she can
be there to support you.

303
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:56,605
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

304
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,507
- I'm so excited.
- To support you.

305
00:09:58,542 --> 00:09:59,775
That's what I said.
I'm really looking forward

306
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,459
- to being there.
- To support you.

307
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:02,961
Yeah, we're saying the same thing.

308
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:04,676
- I am pumped this is happening.
- All right, babe,

309
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,182
maybe your brother doesn't want
to talk about what happened.

310
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:07,249
- Let's just go.
- It's okay.

311
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:08,884
I owe you guys an explanation.

312
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:11,787
I actually started doing drugs
when I was a teenager.

313
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:14,338
You know how Mom and Dad
put so much pressure on us?

314
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,592
Eventually I just kind of cracked.

315
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:18,561
Wait, you felt pressure?

316
00:10:18,596 --> 00:10:20,596
You always seemed to effortlessly thrive

317
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:23,291
at everything. I was so jealous.

318
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:24,871
But knowing that you also felt
the pressure...

319
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,069
All right, we can drop the act.
I just didn't know who was listening.

320
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,570
- What act, now?
- Everything I've said before

321
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:30,120
just now is a lie. I'm being framed.

322
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:31,890
I've been investigating these dirty cops

323
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,691
who are being paid off
by the Brazilian mob.

324
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:35,894
Oh, Brazilian mobsters
are so good-looking.

325
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:37,963
They're just a bunch of Giseles,
the women and the men.

326
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:39,731
Yes, it's insane. They're all gorgeous.

327
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,399
Anyway, I think I got too close.

328
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:43,869
Those dirty cops must have
planted the drugs in my desk.

329
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:46,537
So what you're saying is,
you're not addicted to cocaine?

330
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:48,874
Amy, it's me. I don't even drink coffee.

331
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:50,075
I have too much respect for my body.

332
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,209
This is water.

333
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:52,744
And you didn't feel pressure

334
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,645
- from Mom and Dad?
- No, they're so supportive.

335
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,915
I'd actually love
some constructive criticism.

336
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,483
It's the only way to grow.

337
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,385
Anyway, thank you so much
for bailing me out.

338
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,587
If you can just drop me off
at home, I will clear my name,

339
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:03,951
and things can go back
to the way they were.

340
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:05,456
The way they were. Great.

341
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,286
It's my favorite way of things being.

342
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,128
Okay, Alfonso, I hope
you like it here in holding.

343
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:12,319
It's gonna be a while.

344
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,506
So...

345
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,652
- what they got you in here for?
- Drugs.

346
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:21,455
They want me to flip, but I'm no snitch.

347
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:24,080
I'd rather do the time. How about you?

348
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,471
I pushed a man, just to see him frown.

349
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:27,940
He is terrible.

350
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:31,682
Yeah, it's almost like
casting a robotic old nerd

351
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:32,960
was a huge mistake.

352
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:34,730
Was it a mistake, Sarge?

353
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,787
Or was it a stroke of brilliance?

354
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,422
- What are you talking about?
- Look, you're a good actor.

355
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:40,374
You could even be a great one.
But you're too gentle.

356
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,258
Life hasn't kicked you around enough.

357
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:43,527
I mean, I grew up poor,

358
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:45,195
and my father was emotionally abusive.

359
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,270
It's not enough.

360
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,864
You needed to be rejected by me,

361
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,000
a man you admire so much.

362
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,434
What? So all this was
just to make me mad?

363
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,972
I need you to feel
the anger and resentment

364
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:59,147
that Tyrone McCallister feels
every single day of his life.

365
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:00,806
Who's Tyrone McCallister?

366
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,321
You are.

367
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,721
That's the part I wrote
for you all along.

368
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,269
This is so stupid, Boyle.

369
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:08,538
You can't manipulate somebody like this

370
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:09,906
and then expect them to get on board.

371
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:10,942
Right, Sarge?

372
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:12,020
Sarge?

373
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:14,927
My name's Tyrone.

374
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:17,352
Tyrone McGallagher.

375
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:19,265
- McCallister.
- McCallister.

376
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:21,497
So I checked up on David's case file.

377
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,999
He passed his drug test.

378
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,134
Apparently he has the cleanest
blood they've ever seen.

379
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,735
I knew this was all too good to be true.

380
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,371
Now David's gonna clear his name

381
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:30,840
and singlehandedly take down
drug dealers and dirty cops

382
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,342
and get another medal from the governor.

383
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,243
It sounds pretty dangerous.
Maybe we should help him.

384
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:35,811
Pretty sure he can
handle this on his own.

385
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,169
That's never been a problem for him.

386
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,285
All right, look, Ames.

387
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:41,114
I never had a brother,

388
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,551
but I know four guys who did,

389
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:44,819
and they would have fights
and squabbles,

390
00:12:44,854 --> 00:12:47,943
but in the end, they always
had each other's shells.

391
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:49,825
Are you talking about the Ninja Turtles?

392
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:50,933
Of course I'm talking about

393
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,060
- the Ninja Turtles!
- Ugh.

394
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,362
Look, if something happens
to your brother,

395
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,585
you are gonna regret it,

396
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,563
just like Raph regretted it
when he abandoned Leo

397
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,665
in the Technodrome with Krang.

398
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,867
I don't know what that means.

399
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:00,435
Well, that's on you. It's a classic.

400
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,870
The point is, if your brother gets hurt

401
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,594
and you don't get his back now,

402
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:05,336
it's gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life.

403
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:07,209
You're right.

404
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,877
- Obviously you're right.
- Thank you.

405
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,278
If David gets killed
by the Brazilian mafia,

406
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:12,180
my parents' mantel
is gonna become, like,

407
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:13,882
- a permanent shrine to him.
- No, that's not what I meant.

408
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,117
Oh, the thought of it
makes me want to puke.

409
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:16,394
You've learned the wrong lesson.

410
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,918
Come on, let's go help the bastard.

411
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:19,054
Don't love how we got here,

412
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,389
but we're going where I want.

413
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,204
I'm glad you guys are here.

414
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,873
So this place is run
by the Brazilian mob.

415
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:27,174
My CI tells me there's a ledger
with all the cops on payroll

416
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,326
hidden in here somewhere.

417
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:29,428
I'm guessing it's in that room

418
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:30,690
surrounded by armed guards.

419
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,758
Those are guards?

420
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:32,791
I thought they were models.

421
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:34,021
We need a plan to get past them.

422
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:36,021
So here's what I'm thinking.
I speak a little Portuguese

423
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:38,190
from that time I opened
a school in the favelas of Rio.

424
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:39,191
- Ugh, barf.
- What?

425
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:40,220
I said barf.

426
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:41,689
I can't deal with your bragging anymore.

427
00:13:41,724 --> 00:13:42,857
How is that bragging?

428
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:44,425
I said I speak a little Portuguese

429
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,027
when I'm actually fluent.

430
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:47,595
Ugh, shut up!

431
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,764
Look, if you're so angry
with me, why are you even here?

432
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,565
Because Jake convinced me if you die,

433
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,564
I'd never hear the end of it
from Mom and Dad.

434
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
That's not exactly how I phrased it.

435
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:56,569
Look, I get it. You're jealous.

436
00:13:56,605 --> 00:13:59,040
I'd be jealous too
if someone was better than me

437
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,374
at everything their whole life.

438
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,143
- Oh, no.
- Not everything.

439
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:04,244
- I have more allergies than you.
- Not the best brag.

440
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,913
I have so many allergies,
I just found out

441
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:08,015
- I'm allergic to chia seeds.
- But apparently effective.

442
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,417
I'm allergic to chia and acai berries.

443
00:14:10,452 --> 00:14:12,586
Yeah? My throat gets scratchy
when I eat stone fruit.

444
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,923
Oh, yeah? I'm also
a better dancer than you.

445
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:18,659
Ames, you have badly
misjudged your own abilities.

446
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:20,116
You think you're better than me?

447
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,366
Oh, damn.

448
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:24,050
She's got a shot.

449
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,230
_

450
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:27,267
What, afraid to use your forearms?

451
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:28,401
Pretty good.

452
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,170
You're not using enough elbow!

453
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,673
Guys, those aren't the parts
people feature when they dance.

454
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,675
Now can we please find a way
to distract those guards?

455
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,040
Don't worry, Jake, 'cause
I'm about to end this thing.

456
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,232
Death drop!

457
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,713
Ow!

458
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:41,714
Ow, ow, ow!

459
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,683
- Oh, that looked really bad.
- Are you okay?

460
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:45,517
Oh, look, the guards
are leaving their post.

461
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,518
Looks like they're
coming here to help you.

462
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,787
Jake, you should go now.

463
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,855
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm "fone."

464
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,290
Oh, well, as long as you're "fone."

465
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,025
- Jake, go.
- All right, fine.

466
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:56,459
<i>Believe me, they're perfect.</i>

467
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,130
They're about 5 1/2 pounds each,

468
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,650
and they look so good smushed together.

469
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,433
Or dangling.

470
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:06,506
Get off me, man.

471
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,722
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:09,726
- Hey.
- Cops, man.

473
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,013
- Mm-hmm.
- Word.

474
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:13,295
McCallister, your lawyer's here.

475
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,830
- He wants to talk to you.
- Already?

476
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:17,366
What the hell, man?
I was just getting started.

477
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:18,800
And yet it felt like forever.

478
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:22,203
You were playing at Alfonso,
not with Alfonso.

479
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:23,957
What are you doing right now, Sarge?

480
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:25,874
- Listening to you?
- Yes, listening.

481
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:27,909
What humans do 95% of the time

482
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:29,911
and Tyrone does, apparently,
none of the time.

483
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:32,681
I want you to go back
in there and listen.

484
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:35,096
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah, okay, jeez.

485
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:37,419
I mean, you know, look, take
the note about Tyrone or don't.

486
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:40,021
What do I know? But also, I created him.

487
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:42,212
Hey.

488
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:50,265
McCallister, your lawyer
has more questions for you.

489
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,677
- What?
- Why were you doing that?

490
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:52,901
You said I should listen!

491
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:55,436
Well, listening doesn't
always mean being quiet.

492
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,155
Sometimes, the only way to listen

493
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,589
is to say something.

494
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,640
I'm listening to you right now.

495
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:03,144
Do you see how I listen?
This is me listening.

496
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,645
You're pissing me off, Boyle!

497
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,780
Ah, and he's back!
Hold on to that aggression.

498
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,082
Yeah, go! Go, go, go!

499
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:11,590
What are you looking at?

500
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:13,333
McCallister.

501
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:15,823
Terry, Terry, Terry.

502
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,658
I need you to help me see
what I'm not seeing.

503
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:18,826
Why can't you do this?

504
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,761
You're giving me too many notes.

505
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:23,410
Okay, well, then I can boil
it down for you into one note:

506
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,466
Tyrone is an ocean.

507
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,067
I don't know what that means.

508
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:28,836
It means I want you
to be tough but vulnerable,

509
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:31,005
brave but scared,
jittery but perfectly still.

510
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,054
Also, pace it up a little.
Come on, buddy, you got this.

511
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:35,408
Man, these stupid cops
won't leave me alone.

512
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,071
What the hell? They think I'm a snitch?

513
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,746
- Not me.
- I hear that.

514
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,180
McCallister, I need to talk to you.

515
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:41,281
- No!
- Excuse me?

516
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:42,516
I don't want any more notes.

517
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,951
I've gone undercover before.

518
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:45,563
Now just back off and let me do this!

519
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,129
Uh-oh, Alfonso,

520
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:51,692
seems as though we got a pig
in our midst.

521
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,761
Looks like we can only trust each other.

522
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,863
Come on, man,
you're obviously a cop too.

523
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,758
You keep talking
about how nefarious you are.

524
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,293
<i>Jake, let us in!</i>

525
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:01,268
I think she's gonna be okay,

526
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,870
but she's probably got
a low-grade concussion.

527
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:05,038
I wish you hadn't tried
to do a death drop.

528
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:07,607
The ladies on "Drag Race"
make it look so easy.

529
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:09,108
I know, you don't get
that reference because

530
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:11,010
- you don't have a television.
- Why?

531
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:13,313
Amy, I'm sorry for getting
so competitive back there.

532
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:15,282
You guys are helping me out,
and I should just be grateful.

533
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:17,717
Of course you're being nice
to me when I'm being a monster.

534
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:19,386
Well, you know what, Mr. Perfect?

535
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,720
I'm gonna find that ledger,

536
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:22,055
and I'm gonna save your stupid butt.

537
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,558
- That would be so great.
- Please stop.

538
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,724
- Maybe there's a hidden panel somewhere?
- It's not in the desk.

539
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,126
I bet it's in this old safe.

540
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:29,562
That seems like a lot of work to open

541
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:30,963
every time you have to pay a bribe.

542
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:33,135
I would keep it in this filing cabinet.

543
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,837
I found it!

544
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:39,772
I beat the golden boy!
I'm the golden girl!

545
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,139
<i>Hey, open up!</i>

546
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:42,574
<i>- Who's in there?</i>
- Okay, everybody out.

547
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:43,713
Go! Go, go, go!

548
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:47,644
Hey, get off me!

549
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,947
My God, you're even more
stunning up close.

550
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:54,452
I called for backup,
but it could take ten minutes.

551
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,228
- Should we storm the place?
- Too late.

552
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:57,397
Look, they're bringing Jake out.

553
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:59,972
I told you, I was in the
office because I work there,

554
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,314
and we've actually met a bunch of times,

555
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,052
and it's crazy you don't remember me!

556
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:04,445
What should we do? If they get away,

557
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,845
we'll never be able to track them.

558
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:07,514
Shoot out the tires.

559
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:08,682
You're a way better shot than me.

560
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,217
- You should do it.
- Are you crazy?

561
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:11,885
- You're the golden girl.
- David, take the shot.

562
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,120
I just don't want you to feel
bad about yourself...

563
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:14,255
Take the shot!

564
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,530
You're under arrest, you beautiful man.

565
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,416
Cuff this son of a bitch.

566
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,799
Oh, my God, you also smell so good.

567
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,581
Brazil!

568
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:30,203
All right, so first things first,

569
00:18:30,238 --> 00:18:31,804
I think I owe you both something,

570
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,889
and it's this.

571
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:36,576
Stop clapping!
There's nothing to clap about.

572
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:38,979
Look, I know you're upset,
but everything went great.

573
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:40,880
Great? You ruined this mission.

574
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:42,382
Yeah, we might have gotten him to talk

575
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,117
if you didn't give me notes
every two seconds.

576
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:46,752
Guys, you performed exactly
the way I expected you to.

577
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:49,152
It's just that you were both
supporting characters.

578
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:51,162
Hey, Boyle, I did what you asked.

579
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,392
Alfonso told me everything.

580
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:53,626
Yes! I knew it would work.

581
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:54,995
What? What's going on?

582
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,762
You were never my real star, Sarge.

583
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,298
But I needed to create a scene

584
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,666
so that Alfonso would think
that my mission had failed.

585
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:02,334
Then I could send in...

586
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:05,570
Ricki Sheetz, DJ by night,
gun smuggler by later night.

587
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:07,006
Alfonso started telling me

588
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,673
about all the crazy crap
you guys pulled in there.

589
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,975
He just couldn't stop talking

590
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,676
till he gave me the name
of his supplier.

591
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:14,013
Rosa was my leading lady from the start.

592
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:15,747
- She's the only good actor here.
- She is?

593
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:17,116
Yeah, you know nothing
about my real life.

594
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:19,337
- I'm always acting.
- Well done, Boyle.

595
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,254
You've executed this mission flawlessly.
I'm impressed.

596
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:24,689
Wait, if you were gonna use
Diaz the whole time,

597
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:25,991
why didn't you just tell us that?

598
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:27,526
Because you two would have given it away

599
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:28,793
with your terrible acting.

600
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,129
No offense, but I can read

601
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:32,264
every emotion you're
feeling on your face.

602
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:34,133
- Can you read this one?
- Actually, yes.

603
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:36,367
You're trying to be tough, but inside,

604
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:38,821
you're super impressed by what
I've accomplished today.

605
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:42,540
Damn, you're right. You're good.

606
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,543
Thank you, everyone,
for joining me again.

607
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:47,178
To David. You're my hero.

608
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:49,313
And to Amy. You saved my butt.

609
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:51,201
You're a great cop and a great sister.

610
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,657
Wow. That means a lot coming from you.

611
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:56,887
You've always been a role model for me.

612
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:58,556
He's everyone's role model.

613
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,857
That's why he's on the mantel.

614
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:02,971
I have to go to the bathroom.

615
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,365
Hey, are you okay?

616
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,999
Yeah, I just had to go
to the bathroom, like I said.

617
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,401
Oh, great. I thought you went in there

618
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:12,070
to give yourself a pep talk
in the mirror

619
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:13,370
like the girl
from the deodorant commercial.

620
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:14,905
I don't know what you're referring to.

621
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,040
She wants the big promotion,

622
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:17,407
but there's just one problem.

623
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:19,342
She got skunk pit. We'll watch it later.

624
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:20,978
The point is, I came to comfort you.

625
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,047
Aw, thanks, but I actually
feel really great.

626
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:26,916
I've spent my whole life trying
to beat David at something,

627
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:29,144
but when you were in danger,

628
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:31,282
I just didn't care anymore.

629
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,773
All I wanted was for you to be okay.

630
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:37,127
I may never have the mantel,
but it doesn't matter,

631
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:38,363
'cause I have you.

632
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:39,698
Well, I'm very proud of you,

633
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:41,098
and I also wish you had told me that

634
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,432
before you went to the bathroom,

635
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:44,167
because I really roasted
your mom back there.

636
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,536
And another thing,
you should appreciate Amy more,

637
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:47,904
because she's amazing.

638
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,439
And another thing,
when you come to visit us,

639
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:50,940
you don't have to bring your own coffee.

640
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:52,242
Our coffee is fine.

641
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:54,077
And another thing, I know enough Spanish

642
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:55,612
to understand what <i>idiota</i> means!

643
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:56,945
And another thing!

644
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,014
When you say I have
an "interesting nose,"

645
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,867
I know you mean big!

646
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,427
I got lost in it.

647
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,853
There were, like, 35 "another things."

648
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,622
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

649
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:08,090
You were defending my honor.

650
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,625
And I'm glad you said something.

651
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,960
So should I go back
and apologize to your mom?

652
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:13,229
Oh, hell no.
We're sneaking out the back.

653
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:14,963
Oh, thank God. She is terrifying.

654
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,831
See ya at Thanksgiving, Mrs. Santiago.

655
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:21,613
