00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:12,533
Guys? Guess who I just
got off the phone with.

25
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:13,569
My cousin Pam.

26
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:14,739
What? No. Why would you think that?

27
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,486
You always seemed kind of
jealous of my relationship

28
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:17,524
with him, so I thought maybe

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,315
you called him up to
settle your differences.

30
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,789
I'm definitely not jealous of Pam.

31
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:22,280
He owns a bird shop.
I barely remember him.

32
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,470
You remember the bird shop.

33
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:24,384
It wasn't Pam.

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,962
No, I was actually talking to
none other than Gina Linetti.

35
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:28,480
Really?
No one's heard from her in months.

36
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:30,871
Well, she just invited us
to go check out her new place.

37
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:32,640
I'm surprised you're
so excited to see her.

38
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,462
I mean, she's been blowing
you off ever since she left.

39
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:35,810
- What? In what way?
- She bailed

40
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,978
- on your birthday drinks.
- It wasn't that fun.

41
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,658
She was a no-show
at your Secret Santa party!

42
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:39,591
Christmas is overrated.

43
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:41,686
- She hasn't called you in months!
- I'm not that interesting.

44
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:42,921
Look, what is going on with you?

45
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:45,297
- Are you hangry?
- No. I just ate six hardboiled eggs.

46
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,207
Well, maybe you should've
made it a cool "doz."

47
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:49,281
Look, I know Gina hasn't
been around very much,

48
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,902
but we're gonna spend
time with her today,

49
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:52,445
and it's gonna be just like old times.

50
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:54,328
Gina's gonna be a few minutes.

51
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:55,569
Her photo shoot is running over.

52
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:57,238
Yes, Moses! Lookin' good!

53
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:58,641
Now work those Commandments!

54
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:01,444
See, Sarge? Just like old times.

55
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,224
Ah, Boyle, there you are.
I have a question for you.

56
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,377
Daddy, wait up!

57
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:08,679
Oh, your non-adult is
at our place of work

58
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:10,076
Nikolaj had a half-day at school

59
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:11,626
for Mariano Rivera's birthday.

60
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:12,795
I'm watching him on my lunch break.

61
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:13,905
Nikolaj, say "hi" to Captain Holt.

62
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:15,741
Hi, Captain Holt! How's Mr. Kevin?

63
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,577
Stressed. His annual budget review

64
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:19,547
is today, and a recent change
in federal policy

65
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,317
means his grant situation is... tenuous.

66
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:23,999
- At best.
- Okay.

67
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:25,632
Hey Nikolaj, Daddy
and Captain Holt need to talk.

68
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:26,863
Why don't you go do some drawing?

69
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:30,065
Oh, he loves doing art.
He made a portrait

70
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:32,581
of our dog Biscuit that had
all of his surgical scars.

71
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:33,938
Yes. Children are wonders.

72
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:37,362
I'm conducting a statistical
analysis to get a more nuanced

73
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:39,732
understanding of which areas
in our jurisdiction

74
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,868
need greater police presence with a hope

75
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:43,799
of developing a formula that...

76
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,247
What on Walden Pond is this?

77
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:47,683
Nikolaj, no, that's important!

78
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,185
I'm so sorry, sir. I don't spank him,

79
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:51,368
but I will reprimand him in my own way.

80
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,667
Niko. I love you.

81
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:55,581
- I'm so sorry, Daddy!
- No, no, no.

82
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:57,374
He didn't ruin it, he solved it.

83
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,852
The absolute value of psi.

84
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,522
Nikolaj cracked the equation. Boyle...

85
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:05,771
your boy is a genius!

86
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,518
Jacob! Terrencio!

87
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,454
Give Moses a hug!

88
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,872
Uhh! It's so good to see you!

89
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:15,276
Ugh, that shoot took forever.

90
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:16,609
Did Janelle offer you a snack?

91
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:17,978
She did. I had Linguini.

92
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:19,396
So what's been going on with you?

93
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,083
Well, that's actually why I called.

94
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,886
It's not a big deal at all,

95
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,355
but someone's threatening to murder me.

96
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:25,398
- What?
- Damn, Gina!

97
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,069
I mean, I'm not worried
about it in the slightest.

98
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,638
Anyone who has an online presence

99
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:29,638
gets meaningless threats.

100
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:31,518
It actually is a sign that I made it.

101
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,941
- Congrats?
- Thanks, thank you.

102
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:36,741
The only thing is, I have my
first speaking engagement tomorrow

103
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,735
and the organizer says
he's going to cancel it

104
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,531
unless I have police protection, so...

105
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,467
would you guys come tomorrow
and police protect me?

106
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:46,303
- Yes, of course, yes.
- Oh, thanks so much.

107
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:49,503
This is my agent. I'm so sorry.

108
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,262
Duncan, this better be good news.

109
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,537
<i>Oh, it is... your video's
huge, from Spokane to Spain,</i>

110
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:57,407
<i>you're global, Gines!
Now, let's. Talk. Strategy.</i>

111
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:58,619
This is gonna take a while.

112
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,977
Do you guys want to get drinks
at Shaw's later and catch up?

113
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,680
Oh, yeah. That sounds really fun.

114
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,052
Great. I'll see you then!

115
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,312
- Okay.
- So, Duncs,

116
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,143
I have an idea for a second book.

117
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,746
It's a memoir, and it's made of memes.

118
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:12,883
So, it's called a meme-oir.

119
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,122
Whoa, Rosa! What happened?

120
00:04:16,157 --> 00:04:17,957
I touched poison oak.
The doctor says I have to keep

121
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,126
my hands bandaged for a week
so I don't scratch them.

122
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,856
- How did it happen?
- I was on a nature hike

123
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,460
and I went off-trail
to pick a pretty little flower.

124
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,575
Awwww.

125
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,896
Shut up. Now scram.

126
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:26,999
I have a case report to type up.

127
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:29,413
Uh, there's no way
you're using a keyboard

128
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,147
with your hands like that.
Oh, I could help you!

129
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:35,182
Not to brag, but at typing
camp, everyone called me

130
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,829
"The Finger Queen."

131
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,411
Oh, my God, that sounds really dirty.

132
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,866
I swear that's what it meant.

133
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:41,547
Yeah, it was typing camp.
Nobody thinks that.

134
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,524
Anyway, I don't need your help.

135
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,485
You're really gonna try to make it
through an entire day on your own?

136
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,644
Well, well, well.

137
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,747
Rosa Diaz is finally
gonna learn the lesson

138
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:51,317
that no matter how strong
she is on her own,

139
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,118
true strength comes from
accepting help from others

140
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,227
That's not what's happening.

141
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:57,949
Mm-hmm, yeah.

142
00:04:57,985 --> 00:04:59,280
That's how normal people
take their coats off.

143
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:00,304
I'm fine.

144
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,601
- I can see that.
- This is going well.

145
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:03,581
Clearly.

146
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:14,203
Why are you sliding into
my side of the booth?

147
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,206
Because that side is the solo side.

148
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,668
You always put the person
you want catch up with

149
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:19,503
on the solo side, otherwise
one of us will spend

150
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:21,128
the whole night straining
our necks looking sideways.

151
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:22,754
I'm straining my neck
talking to you right now.

152
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,036
Okay, so don't look at me, Terry.

153
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:25,688
Just face forward. You see me every day.

154
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:26,692
- Fine.
- Fine.

155
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:29,636
I gotta say, I'm surprised Gina
invited us to drinks tonight.

156
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:32,516
She obviously invited us over to her
place because she needed a favor.

157
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:33,927
Why are you still so down on her?

158
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:35,083
I've been through this before.

159
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,586
In college, I had a football
buddy, Bryant Ungerbert...

160
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,701
Oh, lemme guess.
You guys were best friends,

161
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,501
then he got drafted into the NFL,

162
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:43,170
- and now you never talk.
- No, he got drafted into

163
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,324
the Canadian football league,

164
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,993
became a long snapper for Ottawa,

165
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,330
and even that level of
success ruined our friendship.

166
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:50,032
He's still playing?
How is that possible?

167
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,169
You're 35 to 60 years old.

168
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,005
It's Canada. They don't tackle as hard.

169
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,642
Anyway, his career became
the only thing that mattered.

170
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:58,516
He was off doing
photo shoots, commercials,

171
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,286
speaking at long snapping conventions...

172
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:01,555
- Is that a thing?
- In Canada,

173
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:03,524
it's like the Oscars. Look, the point is

174
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,186
he stopped making time for his friends.

175
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:06,855
Fine, but that's not
what's happening here.

176
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,213
Nothing has changed with Gina.

177
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,336
- She's not an Ungerbert.
- Hi.

178
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:13,111
So, Gina won't be able
to make it tonight.

179
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:15,314
She doesn't have time.
But here are your credentials

180
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,422
for tomorrow's event.
Have a great night.

181
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:19,126
Oh, no.

182
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,656
She is an Ungerbert.

183
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:26,619
Hey, Gina's prepping inside.
You get some rest last night?

184
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,085
Yeah, because I got home

185
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,333
from our 9:30 drinks at 9:41.
I was in bed by 10:00.

186
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,814
Then I looked at my phone
for another two hours,

187
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,950
so actually I didn't sleep very well.

188
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,395
But I did realize something.

189
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:36,643
The only thing that
matters to Gina is work.

190
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,686
You don't say?
Where have I heard that before?

191
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:41,069
I don't know, Terry. I don't have
time for your weird memory lapse.

192
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:42,183
I said it last night.

193
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,473
Well, I wish you would've said it to me.

194
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,486
Anyway, I decided I'm not
gonna let it go this time

195
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,893
After we update her on the case,

196
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:48,224
- I'm gonna say something to her.
- Good.

197
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,741
I wish I'd have said
something to Ungerbert.

198
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,443
Long snapper used to be
my favorite position.

199
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,479
- Really?
- Yeah.

200
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:53,860
Hmm. Well...

201
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:55,317
you a weirdo.

202
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:59,100
Timothée Chalamet,
shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.

203
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:02,003
Timothée Chalamet,
shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.

204
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,383
- Gina.
- Oh, sorry.

205
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,852
- I'm doing my vocal warm-up.
- Great.

206
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:06,508
Well, cyber looked into the threats,

207
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:08,009
and they traced
a number of negative comments

208
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,845
back to another internet
celebrity, Marvin Lennox.

209
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,718
Marvin Lennox. Yeah,
I'm not worried about him.

210
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:15,722
- He's an inspirational baker.
- Inspirational baker?

211
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:16,860
What the hell is that?

212
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,986
<i>A man is like a quiche,
and a quiche is only</i>

213
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,056
<i>as strong as its crust.
What's your crust?</i>

214
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:25,026
Oh, that's exactly what it sounds like.

215
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,328
Yeah, he's not a threat.
He lives in Utah, and again,

216
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,130
just to remind you...
inspirational baker.

217
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,132
Right. Well, even so,
we have metal detectors

218
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,034
at all of the entrances,
and we'll keep our eyes peeled

219
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,927
for anything suspicious.
Also, before we head in there,

220
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,563
I wanted to talk to you about something.

221
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,466
- What's up?
- Well, it just kind of

222
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,636
bummed me out that last night
you blew us off.

223
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:43,092
For work. Again.

224
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,846
What? Uh, no.
I did not miss drinks for work.

225
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,016
I had food poisoning.
Did Janelle not tell you?

226
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,851
- No.
- Wow, that's crazy.

227
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,137
'Cause I specifically told her
to tell you... you know what?

228
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:53,855
- I'm gonna fire her.
- You don't have to do that.

229
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,690
- Janelle.
- Oh, God, doing it now?

230
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,158
- Hi, Gina.
- Okay.

231
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:58,562
Well, Sarge and I
should probably hit it,

232
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:00,060
get back in there, survey some people.

233
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:01,178
But have a great show.

234
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,758
Janelle, just remember
you're gonna have a lot of jobs

235
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:04,109
in your life... this is but
a blip on your résumé.

236
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,245
Okay Sarge, let's go.

237
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,259
Wanted to see me, sir?

238
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:09,169
Yes, I wanted to talk
to you about Nikolaj.

239
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,427
How long have you known he was a genius?

240
00:08:11,463 --> 00:08:12,896
I mean, I always knew he was bright.

241
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,732
I just never realized he was that smart

242
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:16,601
Well, there's no sugarcoating it.

243
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:18,237
- You're a terrible father.
- What?!

244
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:19,907
You've been asleep at the wheel, man!

245
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:22,444
What have you done to cultivate
his incredible mind?

246
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,026
- I read to him every night.
- Shakespeare? Tolstoy?

247
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:27,750
- No, nothing that advanced.
- Egads, are you reading him Dickens?

248
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,573
- Yes?
- Boyle!

249
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,059
My father never saw my potential.

250
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,262
In grade school, I wanted
to spend all my free time

251
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:38,066
drawing graphs and charts, but
he insisted I play basketball.

252
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,735
As if I care about
slam dunking a three-pointer.

253
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,270
Don't be my father, Boyle!

254
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,061
I wouldn't dare!
What do you think I should do?

255
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,024
Let me tutor Nikolaj.
Nothing too strenuous.

256
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,711
Maybe some geometry,
statistical mechanics,

257
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:53,672
perhaps some Latin lyric
poetry thrown in for fun.

258
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,141
Oh, I don't know. He's really booked.

259
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:57,122
I guess I could cancel
his cartooning class,

260
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:59,192
- but he really loves it.
- Don't do that.

261
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:01,062
I hate to think of
all the great cartoons

262
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:03,365
humanity missed out on because Einstein

263
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,935
was just too busy reinventing physics.

264
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,204
Okay, I'll cancel the class.

265
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,546
I mean, who needs relativity when
we could've had Einstein's take

266
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,000
on lasagna-eating cats.

267
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,935
- I said I'd cancel.
- Did he hate Mondays?

268
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,802
We'll never know.

269
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:17,033
Okay, I'm going, I'm going!

270
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,244
Ugh, why won't this
dumb monitor turn on?

271
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,013
Because you can't work
without your hands.

272
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:26,791
Trust us. If you could do this job

273
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,116
without lifting a finger,
we would've already cracked it.

274
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,125
Because we're lazy boys.

275
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:31,948
I'm just not doing it hard enough.

276
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:33,726
- Mmm!
- Ooh!

277
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,189
That's a double-sponger.

278
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,219
All right.

279
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:39,360
I am cleaning this up,
and no one is helping me.

280
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,462
Not a problem.

281
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:41,570
Because we're lazy boys.

282
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:50,094
You gotta be kidding me!

283
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,707
_

284
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:55,197
In the beginning, there was nothing.

285
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:58,767
And then God, a woman, said,

286
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,049
"Let there be Gina!"

287
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:07,766
Gina! Please look at me!

288
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,292
You're welcome.

289
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,061
Aaaaah!

290
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:15,229
It's gonna be hard to spot
a crazy person in here.

291
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:17,165
- They're all crazy.
<i>- Tell me about it.</i>

292
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,438
This is more insane than the crowd

293
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:20,467
at the Carly Rae Jepsen
I mean Slayer concert.

294
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:21,739
G-Hive!

295
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:24,609
Are you ready for
three new Gina-mandments?

296
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,974
Number one.

297
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,844
You can be anything
you set your mind to...

298
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,495
as long as you're already great at it!

299
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,182
Number two.

300
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,818
No one knows you can't take it with you!

301
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:39,420
Be buried with your money.

302
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:41,189
Cha-ching!

303
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,358
Number three.

304
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,996
If you fall down nine times...

305
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,929
you gotta reassess your walking,

306
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:49,210
'cause something's wrong.

307
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:53,835
And now, I wanna hear
from you, my baby G-Hive!

308
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,870
Yes, girl in the mustard sweater.

309
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,408
Hi, Gina. I just quit my job

310
00:10:57,444 --> 00:11:00,040
and left my husband who loves
parkour more than he loves me.

311
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,921
And it's all because
of your Gina-mendment:

312
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:04,992
"If the light in your house
is dim, change the bulb."

313
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:06,728
Yes!

314
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:09,331
I have time for 15 more compliments.

315
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:10,950
Hey, Jake. I think Lennox is here.

316
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,052
I see him. You get him.

317
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,363
I'll stick with Gina.

318
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,056
Uh-oh. He's moving.

319
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,213
Coming through.

320
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,748
There's too many hoodies. I lost him.

321
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:22,355
- Get Gina out of here, now!
- And now the time has come

322
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,931
for y’all to meditate.

323
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:26,401
Close your eyes while I sing to you.

324
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,891
♪ Breathe in, breathe out ♪

325
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:31,539
♪ I invented meditation ♪

326
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,141
- R...
- Gina, we gotta go.

327
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:35,269
- Lennox is here.
- Told you I'm not worried about Lennox.

328
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:36,410
Well, it's not your call.

329
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,962
- We're leaving.
- Jake, you're overreacting.

330
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:44,286
On second thought, maybe we
should get out of here.

331
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:49,447
- Okay. Kitchen's all clear.
- Bedroom's clear.

332
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,027
Can't believe I just escaped death!

333
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:52,196
I haven't felt this alive since

334
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,064
I almost got killed by that bus.

335
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,444
I know, right? What a rush.

336
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:57,601
Feel just like Kevin Costner
in "The Bodyguard"!

337
00:11:57,636 --> 00:11:59,603
What? If anyone's
like Kevin Costner it's me.

338
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:01,105
I'm the one carrying Gina!

339
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,790
Well, I think we can agree
we were both Kevin Costner.

340
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,743
- No!
- Jake, that was so dope

341
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:07,445
when you were like, "Clear a path!"

342
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,929
Guys, uniformed officers

343
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:11,414
found Marvin hiding in
a bathroom at the event space.

344
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,840
He's in custody. We got him!

345
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:14,752
That's great!
I hope they give him the chair.

346
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,536
Ooh, we should celebrate.
Champagne's in the fridge.

347
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,538
On it.

348
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,462
Duncan, I almost died. It was amazing.

349
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:26,084
<i>I heard all about it, Gines.
Look, you're trending!</i>

350
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,146
And from my pain comes triumph!

351
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,149
<i>Love that. And we can use this publicity</i>

352
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:32,168
<i>to get more money out of
those bottled water guys.</i>

353
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:33,871
<i>You really impressed them
at drinks last night!</i>

354
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:36,207
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah... we
should talk about this later.

355
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:38,444
<i>Sorry, you're breaking up.
Look, I said they loved you</i>

356
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,003
<i>at the drinks last night...
the drinks last night</i>

357
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,996
<i>that you had with the water people?</i>

358
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,481
<i>Crap, I just hit
the Holland Tunnel, but again,</i>

359
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:46,517
<i>great job with the drinks last night!</i>

360
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:47,834
<i>Bye.</i>

361
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,129
Jake, did you hear that?

362
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:52,199
I did, and there's
been a change of plans.

363
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:54,469
I'm gonna take a rain
check on the champagne,

364
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,219
but it was wonderful seeing you.

365
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:57,989
Why are you talking
like a flight attendant?

366
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,597
This is how I always talk
when everything is okay.

367
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,299
Which it is right now.

368
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,056
Please enjoy the rest of your day.

369
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:07,706
How did Nikolaj do?
Were you able to overcome

370
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,639
- my horrible parenting?
- No, it's far worse

371
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:11,342
than I could've ever imagined.

372
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:13,043
I showed him a periodic
table, and he thought

373
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:14,844
it was a coloring book illustration.

374
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,994
I blame myself.

375
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,628
It's such a classic Boyle trait
not to recognize talent.

376
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,718
My cousin Susan didn't know she
could sing until her late 40s.

377
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,775
Honestly, given the hole
that you've put him in,

378
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:25,978
he needs more expert
help than I can provide.

379
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,681
But, there is...

380
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:29,851
a boarding school
in Switzerland that would be

381
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,014
a perfect fit for him.
He can enroll immediately.

382
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,717
In Switzerland? I'd never see him.

383
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:35,619
Then uproot your life
and move there with him.

384
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:36,855
No one here would miss you.

385
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:38,191
Hmm. We could live in Gruyere,

386
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:39,727
the fondue capital of the world.

387
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:41,838
Oh, I don't know.
It's such a big change.

388
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:42,864
Well, he's the genius.

389
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,247
Why don't we ask him
what he wants to do?

390
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:45,162
Good point.

391
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,189
Niko? We need to talk.

392
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,047
Wait. Why is he writing the solution

393
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:51,682
to my formula for no reason?

394
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:54,320
And why is he drawing
colorful underpants beneath it?

395
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:57,457
Oh, I see what's happening.
He's drawing Boy Riga,

396
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:00,036
loyal sidekick to his favorite
cool superhero, Captain Latvia.

397
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,473
That's his symbol.
He distributes grain evenly

398
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,675
among the working class.

399
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,771
Uh-huh. I see.

400
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,793
So this was all just some coincidence.

401
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:11,029
He wasn't writing absolute value of psi.

402
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:12,140
He was just...

403
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:14,337
doodling.

404
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:19,992
Aaaah!

405
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,377
Raaah! Uhhh! Ahhh!

406
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:28,069
Rosa? Are you stuck in there?

407
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:29,714
No, I'm in here by choice.

408
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,251
Oh, 'cause I hear some banging noises

409
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:35,188
as if someone was struggling
to open the door.

410
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:36,390
No. That was the pipes.

411
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:38,360
Or, is it the sound of you

412
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:40,029
learning how to ask for help?

413
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:41,332
You know, you can't spell

414
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,869
"independent" without "dependent."

415
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,503
And you can't spell "Go [bleep]
yourself" without "[bleep] you.

416
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,803
Jake, I had a work thing.

417
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,561
I can't believe you're being
such a baby about this.

418
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:53,230
I'm not being a baby.

419
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:54,700
Look, I'm sorry I lied, okay?

420
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:56,235
It was a big opportunity for me.

421
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,072
I was having drinks
with the brand director

422
00:14:58,108 --> 00:14:59,764
of a bottled water company.

423
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,220
I can't say which one, but it
rhymes with, "fart water."

424
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:05,156
Perhaps one day I will laugh at that.

425
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:07,924
In the meantime, I'm happy
for all your success.

426
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,928
I hope your partnership with
"fart water" is very fruitful.

427
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:12,279
- Good day.
- Come on, dude.

428
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:13,897
- Just talk to me.
- I would if we were friends,

429
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,156
but you're making it it very clear

430
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:16,592
that we are not, so I shan't.

431
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:18,528
- Oh, you're shanting me?
- Yeah, that's right.

432
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:20,137
- Jake!
- Can't hear you.

433
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,333
- You're shanted!
- Jake!

434
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:23,273
I told you I only talk to my friends.

435
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:24,400
No, Jake.

436
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:26,570
I think I just got stabbed by that guy.

437
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,740
Oh, yeah, ya did.

438
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:30,243
Ya definitely did.

439
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:34,423
Okay. The ambulance is on its way.
They said not to remove the knife.

440
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:35,172
Great.

441
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,482
What's up? I got your text...

442
00:15:36,517 --> 00:15:38,920
Oh, my God, Gina,
there's a knife in you!

443
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:40,134
Jake, did you stab Gina?

444
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,961
I didn't stab Gina, okay?
Lennox wasn't our guy.

445
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:45,011
The real perp did it.
He's in a black hoodie and jeans.

446
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:45,823
He ran that way.

447
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:47,525
- I'm on it.
- I want you to stay calm

448
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,160
and just try to keep all of your blood

449
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:51,443
- inside your body.
- Bitch, what do you think I'm doing?

450
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,648
Yeah, I don't know why I said that.

451
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:55,316
Bring your ass down here so
we can finish our conversation.

452
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:57,035
We can do that later, Gina.

453
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,471
First of all, I have
so much adrenaline pumping

454
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:01,372
through my body right now
I can feel almost nothing.

455
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,107
Secondly, you can't say no to me.

456
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:04,542
- I have a knife in my back.
- Yeah, that tracks.

457
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,338
Okay, fine. So I was saying that

458
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:09,274
ever since you left you've
been kind of a crappy friend.

459
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,544
Brrrrrawwwwwwoo.

460
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,514
We're definitely not having
this conversation right now.

461
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,517
No, it's okay. It just hurt for a sec.

462
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:17,685
Come on, let's do it. Ugh.

463
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:19,421
All right, fine, what was I saying?

464
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:22,659
You were saying that I'm a...
Ahh, bad friend.

465
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:25,697
Right. You're a bad friend.

466
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:27,198
That's what I was saying to you.

467
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,534
- Yeah.
- And just that, you know,

468
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:31,369
you've been really blowing me
off for the last few months,

469
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,246
and last night you
lied to me about being sick.

470
00:16:33,282 --> 00:16:35,082
- That really sucked.
- All right, well, listen.

471
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,885
I'm sorry I lied, Jake.

472
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:39,455
I saw you were getting upset
and I didn't want to hurt you.

473
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:41,858
But I don't know what to say
about the other stuff because

474
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:45,096
this is my life and I don't
want to apologize for that.

475
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:46,932
No, and Gina, you shouldn't have to.

476
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:49,269
Look, I'm really proud of you.
You're totally killing it.

477
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:50,805
Yeah, people want to stab me.

478
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:52,283
I mean, that's a very positive way of

479
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,085
- looking at things, but yeah.
- Thank you.

480
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,922
Ha ha ha ha-ha! Hoo hoo!

481
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,762
♪ I hit a new level of pain ♪

482
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,066
♪ Please keep talkin',
please keep talkin'! ♪

483
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,499
Okay, look. I just wanted you

484
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:03,601
to know that I miss you.

485
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,070
Well, I miss you too dude.

486
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:08,042
Great, so can we agree to
see each other like 5% more?

487
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,478
Deal. Aah!

488
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,483
We're not going to shake it.

489
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,919
Yeah, we'll just take
each other at our word.

490
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:16,589
Oooh! That's a knife!

491
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,769
That is a knife in my back.
That's so weird to say.

492
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,880
There's a knife in my back.

493
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,542
Boyle, may I speak
with you for a minute?

494
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,678
Sure, I was just googling

495
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,383
"good toys for normal children."

496
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,227
Nikolaj may not be a genius,
but he's a very bright child.

497
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:31,763
And on top of that, you were right.

498
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:33,566
He's also a very gifted artist.

499
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,441
Look what he did to my periodic table.

500
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:38,193
Sure, it's a bit
derivative of Kandinsky,

501
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,695
but the palette shows
an impressive comprehension

502
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:40,931
of color theory.

503
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,324
And he's good at clouds, too.

504
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,295
Okay.

505
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,944
I also wanted to say
I was wrong to imply

506
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,613
that you didn't know
what was best for him.

507
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:49,488
Oh.

508
00:17:49,524 --> 00:17:51,241
You're an exceptionally
supportive parent,

509
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:53,197
and I wish my father
had been more like you.

510
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:56,578
Thank you for saying that.

511
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,149
And sir,

512
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:01,508
nothing would make me prouder
than being your big daddy.

513
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,598
Well, we're off track now.

514
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:06,301
So, uh, good day.

515
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:07,470
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

516
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,400
How you feeling, Gina?

517
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:10,668
Sometimes I feel like a nut,

518
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,170
sometimes I don't.

519
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:14,405
Almond Joy's got nuts.

520
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,807
Mounds don't.

521
00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:17,308
She's very hopped up on painkillers.

522
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,243
Hold up, when did you learn French,

523
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,511
Monsieur la baguette?

524
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:21,913
Oh, as a bébé.

525
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,782
Oh, oui! Oui, oui, oui, oui.

526
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,918
It actually helps to
play along, I'm assuming.

527
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:28,486
So what's the latest?
Did you catch the perp?

528
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,987
No. I almost had him.

529
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:33,030
But then he jumped up, grabbed
a flagpole, spun around it

530
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:35,267
like Spider-Man, and then
flipped out of sight on a roof.

531
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:37,445
It was crazy. Officers
are still patrolling the area.

532
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,580
Oh, my God, that's it.

533
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:40,014
That is it! The treasure is

534
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,950
in the Forest of Enchanted Secrets!

535
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:43,718
- Let's go!
- No, we can't.

536
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:46,221
We have to stay here and
guard the Amulet of Destiny.

537
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:47,801
True dat, true dat.

538
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:50,125
Sarge, call me crazy,
but it almost sounds like

539
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,693
whoever stabbed Gina knew parkour...

540
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:54,729
just like the ex-husband of
that lady from Gina's event.

541
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:56,598
Right! Gina convinced her to leave him

542
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,099
and he probably wants revenge.

543
00:18:58,134 --> 00:18:59,573
- I'll look into it.
- Okay.

544
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:02,370
Jake, I cannot wait for this doctor.

545
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:04,239
Will you please grab
this knife out of my back?

546
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,207
- Get it!
- Gina, it's already out.

547
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:07,409
What?

548
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,453
- Hello?
<i>- You win.</i>

549
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:20,121
- Please help me.
- No.

550
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:21,456
What, why? I learned my lesson.

551
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,091
- You were right.
- No, you were right.

552
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,460
For the past four hours,
I've been watching you

553
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:26,937
on the security camera.

554
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:28,996
You have? That's weird.

555
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:30,765
- This isn't about me.
<i>- Still seems weird.</i>

556
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,801
Rosa! Watching you try to open

557
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:34,803
that door and fail again

558
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:37,505
<i>and again and again and again</i>

559
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,807
<i>was inspiring!</i>

560
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:40,475
I was trying to teach you a lesson,

561
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,278
and instead, you taught me a lesson.

562
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:44,746
Great. What lesson is that?

563
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:47,782
There is nothing the human
spirit cannot overcome.

564
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:50,785
<i>So Rosa Diaz, you are not quitting.</i>

565
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,011
You are gonna open that door because

566
00:19:53,047 --> 00:19:56,157
you are badass and you don't
need help from anyone!

567
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,660
Yeah. I'm Rosa Diaz.

568
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,001
You can do this, Rosa!

569
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,036
Uhhhhh!

570
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:09,652
She's doing it!

571
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,342
Uhhhhhh!

572
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:16,144
Yes!

573
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,112
Uhhhhh!

574
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:23,551
- You did it!
- I did it!

575
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:26,034
Oh, that was great!
I love being independent

576
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:29,508
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Oh, okay, I'll help you.

577
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,559
And then you were like,
"We can use the Amulet

578
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:33,361
to fight the Queen of Tears!"

579
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:35,663
I said all of that when I was
on drugs? That's brilliant.

580
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:38,199
Yeah, we basically came up
with an entire amazing story.

581
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:39,467
- We should write a movie!
- Yes!

582
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:41,369
Jake and Gina present, colon,

583
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:42,704
"The Queen of Tears," colon,

584
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,239
"Battle for the Amulet of Destiny."

585
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:46,541
Colon, Part One, colon, of Five.

586
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:48,476
Oh, get those sequel profits... smart.

587
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,245
- Yerp.
- Oh, here comes Terry.

588
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,380
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Oh, you should be, Terrance.

589
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,549
You almost missed
the surprise we got for you.

590
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:55,817
- Huh, what is it?
- I think you mean,

591
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,719
"Who is it?"

592
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,189
Bryant Ungerbert?

593
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,557
Hello, Terry Jeffords.

594
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,759
It's been far too long, old friend.

595
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:08,563
We did the right thing.

596
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:10,498
- Yes we did, Gina.
- Who's Gina?

597
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:11,699
Are you still on drugs?

598
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:14,202
- Yeeeah.
- Oh, tight.

599
