1
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,765
<i>I've just received the email
about whether I've gotten</i>

2
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:06,968
<i>the job as commissioner.</i>

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,629
Well, from the look on my face, I'm
sure you can guess what it says.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,765
No. We have no idea at all.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,367
Just tell us, you monster.

6
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:16,768
Really? No one noticed the slight

7
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:18,582
tension in my labial commissure?

8
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,863
- My lips. I'm smiling.
- Wait, you're smiling?

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,333
Wait, we're allowed
to say "labia" again?

10
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:24,775
- Wait, you got it?
- I got it.

11
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:26,011
Ohh!

12
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:28,113
- Labia.
- Commissioner Raymond Holt.

13
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:30,057
- Labia.
- You gotta stop right now, Hitchcock.

14
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,201
We need to celebrate.

15
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:32,722
Ooh, we need music.

16
00:00:32,758 --> 00:00:35,620
Ooh-ohh, ohh, I brought a
"Jock Jams" CD for the wedding.

17
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:37,827
- Oh, we didn't talk about that.
- It was gonna be a surprise.

18
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,577
Our first dance was gonna be
the "Tootsee Roll."

19
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:41,287
Oh, no, and we didn't get to do it.

20
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:42,857
I know. All right, nobody move.

21
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,069
I'm gonna go get the CD.

22
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,832
I want to thank you all.

23
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,967
What an incredible moment.

24
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,069
30 years of struggle and sacrifice.

25
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:53,171
But it was worth it, because
I finally get to read

26
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:55,640
the ten words I've longed to hear:

27
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:58,497
"Raymond Holt, you are not
the"... oops.

28
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,844
I misread the email.

29
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,109
Didn't see the "not."

30
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:02,947
So...

31
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:06,069
I will not be the new commissioner.

32
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:08,006
♪ Y'all ready for this ♪

33
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,925
Jock jam.

34
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,562
Whoo...

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,861
Why is on one else dancing?

36
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:17,162
Did I miss something?

37
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,697
Feels like I missed something.

38
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:20,599
I'll just keep going until
someone tells me to...

39
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,131
- Stop, Jake.
- All right.

40

41
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:45,457
So Captain Holt is taking
another personal day.

42
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:48,527
In his absence, I will be
running things around here.

43
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:49,972
That's not true. I'm in charge.

44
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:53,396
Mm, no, it's gonna be more of
a Westeros free-for-all, okay?

45
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:54,436
Who will bend a knee?

46
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:55,927
- I will.
- Nobody's bending anything.

47
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:57,005
Let's get started.

48
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,864
Sarge, is Captain Holt all right?
He never miss work.

49
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,101
He said he was at a 49 and
improving at 8.6% a day.

50
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:04,537
So I guess he'll be in soon.

51
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:05,906
Now, we have two...

52
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,811
Guess who just got paid, y'all.

53
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,881
That's right. We got
stacks on stacks on stacks.

54
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,416
Whoa. Where's all that cash from?

55
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,985
Well, my brilliant wife
found a crazy loophole

56
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,220
called "wedding insurance."

57
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:16,221
It's very common.

58
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:17,589
It's like renter's insurance.

59
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:18,757
Oh, my God. Do we have that too?

60
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,292
- Yes.
- You are a wizard.

61
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:22,894
The point is, we are getting
refunded in full,

62
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,931
so we are going on a
super-deluxe, five-star

63
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:27,333
mega-baller honeymoon.

64
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:29,467
So you're not just going to
the Berkshires anymore?

65
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:32,093
Screw that crap hole. It's a dump,
and anyone who goes there is garbage.

66
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,466
I was gonna take Sharon there
for a romantic weekend.

67
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:36,569
Oh, well, congratulations, ya poor.

68
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:38,510
I am so sorry.
Money really changes you.

69
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:40,812
The resort is called Posadita Bonita.

70
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:42,180
And it's in Mexico.

71
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:43,915
Great food, great beaches,
and when I saw

72
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,264
"Ay caramba" there,
I'll fit right in.

73
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,349
I don't think so.

74
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:47,919
Isn't that the place that Gina
is always talking about,

75
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,754
because she gets referral
rewards points?

76
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:50,757
Why, yes, it is.

77
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:53,023
Don't forget to use code GINA30
at checkout.

78
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:55,158
It's super intimate and super fancy.

79
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:57,443
And when we're there,
there's only one rule.

80
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,547
A.B.C.

81
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,928
Always be coconuting.

82
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:03,366
At all times, we will either
be drinking from, eating,

83
00:03:03,402 --> 00:03:05,322
or wearing a coconut.

84
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:08,974
_

85
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:11,109
Oh, this place is amazing.

86
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:12,777
I've never had sex
outside the United States.

87
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,812
What are you thinking about?

88
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:15,480
Weirdly, the same thing.

89
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,948
- Whoa.
- Welcome to paradise.

90
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:18,483
- Margarita?
- Yes, I would love one.

91
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:22,053
But is there any way you
could put it in a coconut?

92
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:23,288
It will be my pleasure, sir.

93
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:24,539
Oh, thank you.

94
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:26,725
I requested a ridiculous thing,
and he's doing it.

95
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,660
Quick, think of more stupid
stuff we can ask for.

96
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:31,129
Grapes. Sorry, I panicked.
And I couldn't think of anything.

97
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:32,464
No, no, no, grapes is perfect.

98
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:34,132
Excuse me, sir, is there any way

99
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,571
you could get my wife some grapes?

100
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:37,274
- Yes, sir, right away.
- He's running.

101
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,713
He's running for the grapes.

102
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:40,071
Here are your drinks

103
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:43,145
and a lovers' toolbox
from a Mr. Boyle.

104
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,457
Ah, thank you so much.
We will never open this.

105
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:46,816
Oh, my God, Jake, look.

106
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,171
Yes, the grapes.

107
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,341
Oh, and you brought cheese.
I don't even want cheese.

108
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:51,978
No, Jake, in the lounge.

109
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,061
Captain Holt?

110
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,587
Peralta?

111
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:58,162
Ay caramba.

112
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,026
Gina, what the hell?

113
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,215
New phone, who dis?

114
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:03,662
You can't do that in person.

115
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:04,793
It's Charles.

116
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:06,698
Boyle. Your coworker.

117
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,199
Oh, hey, Charles.

118
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:10,456
I just found out that
your mom left my dad.

119
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:11,744
They're getting divorced.

120
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,104
Eh, they had a good run.

121
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,006
Fun fact: The average
American marriage

122
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,374
lasts fewer than two days.

123
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:18,176
- That's not true.
- It doesn't have to be.

124
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,277
It's commentary.

125
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:20,945
Well, you know who didn't
think it was a good run?

126
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,423
My daddy, Lynn Boyle.

127
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,626
He's inconsolable.

128
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:24,962
Well, I'm sure he'll get over it.

129
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:26,751
No, Boyles don't "get over it."

130
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:28,119
It becomes part of us.

131
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:30,288
It lives within us. It eats us out.

132
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,956
We have to get them back together.

133
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:33,358
- Pass.
- Well, I'm doing it with

134
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:35,093
- or without your help.
- Okay, without.

135
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:36,695
Okay, you called my bluff.
It has to be with your help.

136
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:37,896
And I'm not taking no for an answer.

137
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,897
- No.
- Okay, you did it again.

138
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:40,198
Why are you like this?

139
00:04:40,232 --> 00:04:41,276
I don't know.

140
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,569
Hey, Sarge, I have a problem,
and I would ask Holt,

141
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:48,002
- but since he's not back...
- You came to Top Dog Terry.

142
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,074
Smart move.

143
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,660
I've been solving problems
all day long.

144
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,046
Okay, so you know that meth
case I've been working on

145
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,327
for the last two months?

146
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,281
The Department of Sanitation
police want to poach it

147
00:04:58,317 --> 00:04:59,818
from me, because the drugs
were found in a dumpster.

148
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:00,901
They're saying it's garbage-related.

149
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:01,986
This is an easy one.

150
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,246
Tell them to screw off.

151
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,221
See? Problem solved.

152
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,226
Yeah, well, I did that,
and they threatened to make

153
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,323
a formal complaint to the mayor.

154
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,789
Then just let them have the case.

155
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:12,125
Problem solved.

156
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:14,863
Terry, I've been working
on it for two months,

157
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,626
and those dummies are gonna blow it.

158
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:20,837
Right. Well, you could
partner up with sanitation.

159
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,409
Problem solved? Woof-woof?

160
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:24,909
Nope. Headquarters won't allow it
due to budgetary reasons.

161
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,945
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

162
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:29,080
You know, Captain Holt was
writing an instruction manual

163
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:31,082
for his replacement in case
he was named commissioner.

164
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:32,117
Maybe he could tell you what to do.

165
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:33,364
That's not necessary.

166
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:35,787
Top Dog Terry can make a decision.

167
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:36,821
And what would that be?

168
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,595
Does Top Dog Terry want a
moment to think about it?

169
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,377
Woof-woof.

170
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:46,429
<i>Since the rejection, a great
sadness has enveloped me.</i>

171
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,500
I kept expecting this
dark feeling to pass,

172
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:49,769
but it's only gotten worse.

173
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,439
Not getting the job you want stinks.

174
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:54,038
In first grade, I was passed
over for line leader,

175
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:55,252
and I'm still pissed.

176
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,641
Kyle D.'s lines had curves
and gaps and cutting galore.

177
00:05:58,677 --> 00:05:59,978
It was a frickin' carnival.

178
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:01,613
Yeah. What's a line leader?

179
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,014
Well, it's not just that
I didn't get the job.

180
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,449
It's that John Kelly did.

181
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:08,453
He's already released a memo detailing
his "vigilant policing" initiative.

182
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:10,321
It's essentially a return
to stop and frisk.

183
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:14,025
Choosing him is a betrayal
of everything I stand for.

184
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:15,860
I feel the same way about Kyle D.

185
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:17,829
I tried to suck it up
and go back to work.

186
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:19,397
I put on my uniform
and got in my car.

187
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:22,693
And next thing I knew,
I was on a plane to Mexico.

188
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,063
I didn't even pack a bag.

189
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:26,905
I bought a bundle of novelty
shirts at a nearby gift shop.

190
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,939
This one says, "What's up, beaches?"

191
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:31,142
Instead of "bitches"
for humor reasons.

192
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:33,378
- But you hate humor.
- Well, I'm a joke now,

193
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:35,013
so it suits me.

194
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:38,516
Mm-kay. But, how did
you end up here in Mexico

195
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,718
at the exact same tiny resort as us?

196
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,721
Gina's been talking up
this place up for years.

197
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:44,854
Referral Code GINA30.

198
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,091
I had no idea you'd be here.

199
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:48,726
You know what? It's fine, sir.

200
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:50,695
A lot of people go on their
honeymoon with their boss.

201
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:52,063
Nope, I thought if I said it out loud

202
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,097
it would normalize it,
but it's weird.

203
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:54,165
It's gonna be okay.

204
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,297
How long are you staying, sir?

205
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,035
Just until I get my head right.

206
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,535
But don't worry.
I'll steer clear of you two.

207
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:00,801
You won't even know I'm here.

208
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,360
This place is so romantic.

209
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:07,010
Yeah, and so... intimate.

210
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:09,380
Don't worry.
I'm not listening to you.

211
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:11,757
I'm just thinking about
how this sea bass is cold

212
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:14,564
but not as cold and cruel
as the hands of fate

213
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,259
that have thrust my entire life
into darkness.

214
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,525
Ah, damn it.

215
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,955
I just ordered the sea bass.

216
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:25,136
Ahh, babe, this is so nice.

217
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,355
There are hot stones on
our butts for no reason.

218
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:28,399
Not on mine.

219
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,003
My butt stones keep falling off,

220
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,341
because I'm so tense about Holt
being here and ruining everything.

221
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:34,130
- It hasn't been that bad.
- Really?

222
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,415
Oops. Sorry.

223
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:38,916
Can't even float right.

224
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,417
Just push me away.

225
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,886
Everyone else does.

226
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:45,822
It's not great, but as long
as we stay in here, we're safe.

227
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,524
Peralta, Santiago I'm in your room.

228
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:49,092
What? How?

229
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,056
Patio door was open
I pushed through the hedge.

230
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:54,312
Tell me, what is it about me
that screams loser?

231
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,915
Yeah, you know,
we're kind of in the middle

232
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,584
of gettin' massages right now, sir.

233
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:59,052
Oh, how thoughtless of me.

234
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:00,954
I'll get down here so you can
see my face.

235
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:02,151
Oh, no, that's...

236
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:05,558
Hello. The question was,
what is it about me

237
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:08,766
that screams loser?

238
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,098
I can't figure out what went
wrong between our parents.

239
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,222
They were so in love.

240
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:15,133
Oh, okay, so we're having
a conversation?

241
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,379
No, to get them back together,

242
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:17,937
we need to know what happened.
Did your mom tell you?

243
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,005
- Nope.
- Damn it.

244
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,090
Okay, let's brainstorm.

245
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,369
It could be that my dad is too
clingy or too masculine.

246
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,144
You know what? I'm going
to play a game on my phone

247
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,745
while you go on this little journey.

248
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,118
He overshares, he's indecisive,

249
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,444
he's always crying.

250
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,650
Oh, I made it inside the temple.

251
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,252
He wears a kimono a lot.

252
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:33,753
I became a hawk. I have talons.

253
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:34,897
Well, he can't keep a secret.

254
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,158
He has a clinically loose pelvis.

255
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:38,623
Okay, that did break through.
I heard "loose pelvis."

256
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,993
Charles, you've got to stop.

257
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:41,174
It's none of those things.

258
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,829
Wait. You said your mom
didn't tell you anything.

259
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,464
- Do you know what happened?
- Yes, I do.

260
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:45,932
And it's none of your
business, Charles.

261
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:48,435
Just stop sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

262
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:49,447
Really, Gina.

263
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:52,455
And where does my nose belong
if not inside our parents?

264
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,774
Okay, so we can get away from Holt.

265
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,209
I mean, should we tell him to leave,

266
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,210
that he's ruining our honeymoon?

267
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:58,336
No, we can't.

268
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,037
That would crush him, and
he's already so crushed.

269
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,183
Wait, I got it.

270
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:04,184
We kill Holt.

271
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:05,091
No.

272
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,454
No, that was crazy for
a multitude of reasons.

273
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,456
We have a bunch of fun
activities planned.

274
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,692
If we include him, it'll cheer
him up, and he'll leave.

275
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,128
Right, but aren't most
of our activities

276
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:16,557
kind of geared towards couples?

277
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,739
Name one couples' activity
that wouldn't be more fun

278
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,895
with your boss there.

279
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:22,033
Welcome to Sensual Food Tasting:

280
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,270
The Art of Feeding Your Lover.

281
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:25,547
I feel like I don't belong here.

282
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:29,275
Mm, I love how the mud
revitalizes your skin.

283
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:31,357
And I love how it masks my shame.

284
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,342
I am loving this.

285
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:35,226
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

286
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:36,629
Mmm.

287
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:38,547
This is actually quite pleasant.

288
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:42,211
You know, when you invited me to
join you today, I was skeptical.

289
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:44,043
I had been sitting by the pool

290
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,981
contentedly watching a bee
struggle to avoid drowning

291
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,585
and thinking to myself
how I am like that bee.

292
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,713
Man, I hope it survived.

293
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:51,971
We can't afford to lose
any more bees.

294
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,333
It didn't. The point
is that I am glad

295
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:55,968
you invited me into
your frivolous activities.

296
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,737
You helped me to remember
there's more to life

297
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:58,839
than the NYPD.

298
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,974
Wow, that's great to hear, sir.

299
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,110
I feel a lot better.

300
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,348
I think I may be heading home.

301
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,819
Unless you need a third
for tonight's activities.

302
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,237
- What are we...
- Sensual pottery.

303
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,261
I think we're good.

304
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:10,647
Sarge, I keep getting calls
about my drug case from...

305
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:12,016
What the hell is going on?

306
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,286
Nothing. Just deciding
what to do about

307
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,823
your sanitation issue, like a boss.

308
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,193
You're looking for Captain
Holt's manual aren't you?

309
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:19,203
Please, Diaz.

310
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:22,101
Top Dog Terry does not need to
look for Captain Holt's manual.

311
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:24,164
He knows it's on his computer.

312
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,834
Top Dog Terry was
looking for the password.

313
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,050
Why don't you just
make your own decision?

314
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,005
I did that, and I'm very proud of it.

315
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,071
I just want to make sure
Captain Holt would make

316
00:10:32,105 --> 00:10:33,874
the same decision so I
can be proud of him too.

317
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,409
Gina. Do you know
Captain Holt's password?

318
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:39,078
Oh, Terry, just because
I know all your passwords

319
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,738
doesn't mean I know Captain Holt's.

320
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,348
Okay, well, we could
probably guess it.

321
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:45,251
Why don't you try
BaldByChoice or PecMan

322
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:47,186
or MacklemoreEnthusiast?

323
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,704
Stop saying my passwords. Damn, Gina.

324
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,434
Now Terry's got to
update his keychain.

325
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,272
Start simple. Kevin with a capital K
and a 1 instead of an I.

326
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:55,809
Oh, I feel good about that.

327
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,794
Locked out? Too many failed attempts?

328
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,218
I only guessed once.

329
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,732
Computer will now delete hard drive?

330
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,479
I've got to fix this.

331
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:11,212
Good. You fixed it.

332
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:12,837
He's leaving. Our plan worked.

333
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,881
We saved our own honeymoon,
and fun bonus,

334
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,090
- we cheered up Holt.
- Yes.

335
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:17,783
Okay, it's time to celebrate.

336
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,318
You know what that means.

337
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:21,420
This B needs a C in her A.

338
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:22,689
Oh, my God.

339
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,223
This babe needs a
coconut in her arms.

340
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:27,049
Oh, I thought you were saying

341
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,381
this [bleep] needs a [bleep]
in her [bleep].

342
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:29,951
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that was my reaction.

343
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:31,455
All right, I'll go get us a
couple of coconuts.

344
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:33,566
Ahh, hey there, Captain.

345
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,434
Haven't seen you looking this
happy since they picked up

346
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,137
"The Durrells in Corfu"
for a fourth season.

347
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:39,808
Yes, well, I've reached the
best part of every vacation:

348
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:40,949
reviewing the charges.

349
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:42,419
Well, don't let me interrupt.
Have a safe flight.

350
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,089
And I'll see you back
at the Nine-Nine.

351
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,110
No, you won't; I'll never be
going back there again.

352
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,114
What? Why? I'm confused.

353
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:50,583
You and Amy made me see
that there's more to life

354
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:53,114
than the NYPD, so I'm quitting.

355
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:55,478
Oh.

356
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,766
Well... what a satisfying result

357
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:02,757
that we all were hoping would occur.

358
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,030
Hold on. So let's
just back up a second.

359
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:08,165
When you say you're quitting,
you mean quitting

360
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,483
for, like, a couple of weeks,
and then you'll come back

361
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,013
Jordan-style with a new badge number?

362
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:12,535
No, I mean, quitting permanently,

363
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,721
I'm putting in my resignation
as soon as I get back home.

364
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:16,211
I better hurry if I want
to be at the airport

365
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:17,714
six hours ahead of my flight.

366
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,072
Hey, you know what?
I should drive you there.

367
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,901
Will you come with me to grab
my keys from the room?

368
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,405
Okay, they're just
right in here, so...

369
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:29,498
You're not leaving this room.

370
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,792
- What the hell is going on?
- I can't let you quit.

371
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:34,671
Yes, but why the candles
and rose petals?

372
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,773
- Wuh-oh.
- Is that Mr. McClane I hear?

373
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,894
'Cause someone's about to Die
Harrr... oh, my God.

374
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,009
Why is Captain Holt here?

375
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:45,199
Because he's gonna... wait,
are you dressed like

376
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:46,435
Bonnie Bedelia in "Die Hard?"

377
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,870
- I am.
- For sexy reasons?

378
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:49,301
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

379
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:50,356
Jake, why is he here?

380
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:51,616
Because he's quitting the force,

381
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:53,086
so I brought him
to convince him not to,

382
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:54,690
but obviously that is
not important anymore.

383
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:56,293
All right, Captain,
it's been a good run.

384
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:57,643
Thank you for teaching me
the importance of a tie

385
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,884
in the workplace, and the door
is right over here.

386
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,178
Whoa, whoa, wait. What?
You're quitting?

387
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,182
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

388
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:04,389
We're keeping you right here.

389
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:06,279
How are you going to do that?
Physically restrain me?

390
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:07,282
Great idea.

391
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:08,852
Is there anything in Charles's
box of nightmares

392
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,304
that could be used to tie up Holt?

393
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:14,680
Yes. Literally everything in here
could be used to tie up a person.

394
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:17,942
Wow, Terry, put Captain
Holt's computer back together?

395
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:19,546
- Looks great.
- Sure did.

396
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,883
Couldn't find room inside
for this stuff, though.

397
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,006
Well, is there any chance
the info on in computer

398
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,408
was maybe saved to the cloud?

399
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:26,460
I don't know.

400
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:29,812
Gina, was Captain Holt's hard
drive backed up to the cloud?

401
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:31,480
- Yeah.
- Then why did you let me try

402
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:32,548
to rebuild his computer?

403
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:33,781
Because I'm a rascal.

404
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:37,819
Okay, so I just log onto
the cloud as Captain Holt

405
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:40,490
and click "forgot password"

406
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:42,661
and answer his security questions.

407
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,613
First up: What is God?

408
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:46,829
<i>Hey, Gina.</i>

409
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:48,864
Did you see "Real Housewives"
last night?

410
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,389
If she says no, then
ask about "Below Deck."

411
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:52,561
What are you doing?

412
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:54,064
She's getting suspicious,
Scully. Act natural.

413
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,452
Are you wearing an earpiece?

414
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:57,820
Tell her no. Scully, stop
saying what I'm saying.

415
00:13:57,856 --> 00:13:58,906
Be normal.

416
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:01,037
Charles, what are you doing?

417
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,171
Damn it, Gina.

418
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,407
What does it look like I'm doing?

419
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,913
I'm trying to unlock your phone
using a mask of your face

420
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,917
so I can find out why
your mom left my dad.

421
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:09,253
Charles, give me my phone.

422
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,578
Okay, fine.

423
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:14,457
- Boom, unlocked it.
- Give me my phone, Charles.

424
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:16,459
Not until I find out or
parents are breaking up.

425
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,094
- Give it.
- Scrolling, scrolling.

426
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:19,662
- Give me my phone, you idiot.
- You were the reason.

427
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:21,796
You sent her a text that says,
"You should divorce him"?

428
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:24,038
Okay, yeah, but that's
open to interpretation.

429
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:25,508
No, but then she says,
"I don't want to,"

430
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:27,278
and then you say, "But you have to.

431
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:28,981
"Leave him now, and divorce him.

432
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,226
Don't tell him why."

433
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:32,350
Okay, yeah, you did interpret
it correctly.

434
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,966
Shame, shame.

435
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,914
I'm so sorry I brought
Holt back here.

436
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,816
I had no idea you were doing
this whole "Die Hard" thing.

437
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,617
Man, you really got the hair
exactly right.

438
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:44,740
Did you contact the onset hair
stylist, Paul Abascal?

439
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:45,809
No, this is a wig.

440
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,503
Oh, that's cool too.
So here's what I'm thinking.

441
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:49,935
We let Holt go, I have sex with
Holly Gennaro but hotter.

442
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,405
The squad handles the captain,
or disbands, whatever,

443
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:53,605
we have sex again...

444
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:55,375
Okay, stop suggesting that.
We need to stay focused.

445
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,040
- Right.
- Holt it fragile.

446
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:58,543
We need to be gentle, okay?

447
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,046
- Just follow my lead.
- With pleasure.

448
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,516
I love the view. I'm sorry.

449
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:03,586
This outfit is driving me insane.

450
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:06,675
Hello, sir. Sorry again for
tying you spread eagle

451
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,256
- on the bed.
- Apology not accepted.

452
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,526
Look, I know you're
upset, but this isn't

453
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,763
your last chance to
become commissioner.

454
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,033
John Kelly's old.

455
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:16,469
He's not gonna be in office forever.

456
00:15:16,505 --> 00:15:18,039
True, but he'll just
be replaced by another

457
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:19,375
mediocre old white man.

458
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:20,520
Nothing will ever change.

459
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,524
All right, well, what
about all your goals

460
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,795
for the Nine-Nine?

461
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:25,505
You still have so much
left to accomplish.

462
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,808
Wrong, I've accomplished everything

463
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:27,921
that I set out to do..

464
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,999
I wanted to reduce crime, and I did.

465
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,500
There's no crime in Brooklyn anymore.

466
00:15:31,535 --> 00:15:32,744
Seems like a bit of a stretch.

467
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,614
What about improving
community relations?

468
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,117
Done. Everyone loves the police.

469
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:37,136
It's embarrassing.

470
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:39,268
Way off. All right, Ame,
step aside; I got this.

471
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:41,138
Captain, what about
the Halloween Heist?

472
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,309
I'll just come in and win it
and then go back to my house.

473
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:45,046
- Damn it. I'm out.
- Jake.

474
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,349
All right, fine, sir, do you
know why I love coming to work?

475
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:49,151
Because there's a bumper
pool table in the break room.

476
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:50,986
Yes, obviously I love
the bumper pool table.

477
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:53,105
But do you want to know
another reason why?

478
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:54,276
You.

479
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:56,358
You've made me a better cop.

480
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:57,793
You've made me a better person.

481
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,259
I've learned so much from you.

482
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,248
So you can't quit.

483
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:03,097
Because I need you.

484
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:07,290
- Oh, please. How selfish.
- What?

485
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:08,737
That little speech you just gave.

486
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:10,539
It was all about you
and what you need.

487
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:12,641
How unbelievably selfish.

488
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,643
Okay, well, I don't want
to get mad right now,

489
00:16:14,678 --> 00:16:16,316
'cause Amy's worried about you, so...

490
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:17,907
No, screw that noise.

491
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,317
How dare you call Jake selfish?

492
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,551
He just wasted his entire honeymoon

493
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:24,386
trying to take care of you
while you wallowed

494
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,222
in your misery like a little baby.

495
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:28,246
- That seems a little harsh.
- Oh, does it?

496
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:29,883
- I don't give a hoot.
- Oh, damn.

497
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:32,054
For the last five years,
all I've done is

498
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,858
give a hoot about you
and what you think.

499
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,728
I gave a hoot about you as a boss.

500
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:38,265
I gave a hoot about you as a mentor.

501
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,169
I gave a hoot about you as a friend.

502
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:41,772
She gave so many hoots.

503
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:43,775
Not anymore.
After the way you've acted

504
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:46,245
and what you just said to
Jake, I don't give a hoot,

505
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:48,048
what you think, and I really don't

506
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:51,586
give a hoot if you decide
to quit the NYPD, so do it.

507
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:52,786
I'm all out of hoots.

508
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:53,857
I'm hootless.

509
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:57,273
- Now, what I want to say is...
- Jake.

510
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,676
Coming Holly Gennaro.

511
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,960
Hey, I thought piña coladas
might be too festive,

512
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:05,860
so I got two super-depressing
coconuts filled with Merlot.

513
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:08,031
I'm not depressed. I'm relieved.

514
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,689
For the first time all week,
it's just the two of us.

515
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:11,971
I'm right here.

516
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:14,505
I escaped using some of
the lube Boyle sent you.

517
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,860
It got everywhere. I had to change.

518
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:18,998
Yeah, and your new shirt is
very aggressive and confusing.

519
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:21,537
Is the pineapple the slut,
or is it calling someone else a slut?

520
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,581
Clearly the pineapple is the slut.

521
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:25,337
- Huh.
- Look, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

522
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:27,754
Yeah? Maybe find someone
who gives a hoot.

523
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,393
Try an owl cage.

524
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,731
Oh, honey, I love you,
but not your best.

525
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,493
Look, you have every right
not to accept my apology,

526
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,209
but at least hear it first.

527
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:38,430
I'm sorry I said Jake was selfish.

528
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:40,099
I'm sorry I ruined your honeymoon.

529
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,968
I'm sorry I interrupted your
"Die Hard"-themed sexcapades.

530
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:45,558
You don't have to list
everything; it's cool.

531
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:48,562
Right. I thought if
I played by the NYPD's rules

532
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:50,799
and didn't make any waves, one
day I would rise to a position

533
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:52,770
where I could make meaningful change.

534
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,808
When they hired John Kelly,
I realized I was wrong,

535
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:57,779
and I thought I was out of options.

536
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:00,019
But then you tied me
to your bed, legs akimbo,

537
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:03,262
and made me realize
there was another way.

538
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,895
I could not give a hoot.

539
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,930
Wow, the hoot thing is catching on.
Didn't see that coming.

540
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,276
I'm going to go directly
to the mayor and tell him

541
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:13,030
John Kelly's "vigilant
policing" proposal

542
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,700
is regressive and counter-productive,

543
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:16,864
and if he implements it,
I'm gonna make

544
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,052
a big stink in the press.

545
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,503
Going over the commissioner
and threatening the mayor, sir?

546
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:21,930
Don't you think that'll piss him off?

547
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,821
I don't give a hoot.

548
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:26,767
Listen, I'm on the next plane back,

549
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:28,837
but I wanted to pay for you two
to extend your stay

550
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:30,870
so you can have a proper honeymoon.

551
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:32,874
Oh, sir, thank you.

552
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,711
That's very nice, right, Jake?

553
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,746
Yeah, super cool.

554
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,365
Just out of curiosity
asking for a friend,

555
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:39,435
where did you get the shirt,
and how much did it cost?

556
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,894
Ooh, you're still wearing the mask?

557
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:44,449
Yeah, to hide my sadness.
I'll take it off.

558
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:45,585
No, don't.

559
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:47,756
For some reason, it's easier
to care about what you say

560
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,177
when you look like me.

561
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,339
Why did you tell your
mom to leave my dad, Gina?

562
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,376
Is it so bad being a Boyle?

563
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:56,380
Yes, it's terrible, but that's
not why I did it.

564
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,016
My mom was cheating on your dad,

565
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:59,652
so I told her she had to break
it off.

566
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,089
What? Why didn't you tell me?

567
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,893
Because I didn't want
to hurt you or him.

568
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:05,564
She was being disgusting, so
I told her she had to end it.

569
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,901
You were trying to protect us.

570
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,311
Gina, you were actually being sweet.

571
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,810
Uh-doi.

572
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:12,925
- How's it going, Sarge?
- Not good.

573
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,027
I'm reading this book on
religion, and apparently

574
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:16,747
there's some debate
as to what God is.

575
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:17,749
Don't worry about it.

576
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,252
- Gina had the manual.
- What?

577
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:20,631
Why didn't she just give it to me?

578
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,714
'Cause she's a rascal.

579
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,031
Look at what it says.

580
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:26,238
"Never use italics, lest
people think you are

581
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:27,706
a con-man or a clown."

582
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,368
I'm not sure how this applies here.

583
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:30,571
No. Under that.

584
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:32,908
"If you are unsure of what
to do in any situation,

585
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:35,913
consult Sergeant Jeffords."

586
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,935
I trust him completely."

587
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,981
Well, that's a kick in the butt.

588
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:41,769
So what should I do, Sarge?

589
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,291
Tell sanitation you'll
work the case together.

590
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,463
You're the primary,
and HQ can take it out

591
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:48,665
of the supplemental budget.

592
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,158
- I'll find the room.
- Cool.

593
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,590
Top Dog Terry's back.

594
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:55,467
<i>Okay, you ready?</i>

595
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:56,559
Mm-hmm.

596
00:19:58,271 --> 00:19:59,638
Hello.

597
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:00,740
Oh, my God.

598
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:02,214
Are you Melvil Dewey?

599
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,583
Indeed I am.

600
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,868
I invented the Dewey decimal system,

601
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,907
but right now I'm working on
the Do-me decimal system.

602
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,043
Mm-hmm, yeah.

603
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,079
This is really working for me.

604
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,215
- Really?
- Yeah.

605
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:14,964
- Awesome.
- So, Mr. Dewey,

606
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,334
can you save me from the
terrorists that have taken over

607
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,569
Nakatomi Plaza?

608
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:20,168
Yes, Holly Gennaro,

609
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:25,335
I just need to file them in the
library... card... catalog.

610
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:26,665
Yeah, this is really hard to track.

611
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,968
Let's just take our clothes off.

612
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:29,054
Oh, thank God.
This old jacket is so hot.

613
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,077
Yeah.

614
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:31,802
- _
- <i>That was magical.</i>

615
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:34,219
- I can't believe we're back.
- I refuse to accept it.

616
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:35,488
I'm still coconuting.

617
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:36,857
This is filled with coffee.

618
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:37,943
It is very hot.

619
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,645
Coconut is not a good insulator.

620
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,646
No, it's not.

621
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:42,662
- Captain.
- Peralta, Santiago,

622
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:44,232
how was the end of the honeymoon?

623
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:45,568
It was amazing.

624
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:47,739
Not to brag, but I saw a sea turtle.

625
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:49,076
Kind of sounds like
you're bragging, babe.

626
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:50,579
I was. It looked right at me.

627
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:51,891
How'd it go here?
Did you contact the mayor?

628
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,661
Yes. I voiced my concerns
as soon as I got back.

629
00:20:54,111 --> 00:20:56,012
He heard me out, and
he's put John Kelly's

630
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,159
"vigilant policing" initiative
under review.

631
00:20:58,195 --> 00:21:00,162
Way to go, No Hoots Holt.

632
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:02,174
- Was Kelly pissed?
- Very much so.

633
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,112
To retaliate, he closed the
bottom floor of the Nine-Nine

634
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,515
for renovations indefinitely.

635
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:07,851
Everyone's been moved to our bullpen.

636
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:09,140
Wait. What?

637
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:10,781
Prepare yourselves.

638
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,564
The Nine-Nine is at war with the NYPD.

639
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:19,621
Ay caramba.

640
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,570
