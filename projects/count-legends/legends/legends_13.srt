1
00:00:00,778 --> 00:00:02,865
I'm here! I'm here, I'm here.

2
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:04,968
You can start the meeting now.

3
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:05,936
The meeting is over. You're late.

4
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:08,238
You missed roll call and the tutorial

5
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:09,573
on using the new copiers.

6
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:11,381
Six years, and no matter how hard I try,

7
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:13,274
I still can't get you to understand
the importance of being punctual.

8
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,992
Maybe you should just give up
and accept me for who I am?

9
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:16,479
No, I will break you.

10
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:17,532
- Right now.
- Oh.

11
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:18,872
While you were out being tardy,

12
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:20,941
I was hard at work
devising a special punishment.

13
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:23,808
I've crafted an intricate
personal high five

14
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,489
with everyone in this office except you.

15
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,857
What? But you hate high fives.

16
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,192
Yes, every minute of it was hell.

17
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:31,576
But it'll be worse for you.
Squad, dismissed.

18
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,413
Good-bye, Diaz.

19
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:36,065
Salute into a fanny waggle?

20
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,801
- Good-bye, Boyle.
- Oh, the snake charmer!

21
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:40,025
Good-bye, Jeffords.

22
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:43,172
- That's a butt bump.
- Good-bye, Santiago.

23
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:45,141
Double fist bump reverse explosion

24
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:46,976
into a Pete Townshend strum.

25
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:51,047
All right, that was terrible, but
it's over now, and I made it through.

26
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:52,115
Good-bye, Leonard from Xerox.

27
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,617
What? No, no, no.

28
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:55,752
The copy guy?

29
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,269
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

30
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,219
So nice of you to stop by, Kevin.

31
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:18,674
Enjoy your day. I hope it's productive.

32
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,979
Thank you, Raymond.
I hope your day is productive as well.

33
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:23,845
PDA in the office? My, my.

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,281
- Couldn't help myself.
- Hmm.

35
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:28,237
Oh, may I please use the precinct
facilities before I head to work?

36
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,706
Yes. Thank you for
asking for permission.

37
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:30,756
Thank you for granting it.

38
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:37,458
- Whoomp.
- There it is!

39
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:39,735
Got to say, I could have used
a little more oomph on the whoomp.

40
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:40,896
That's the oomphiest whoomp you'll get.

41
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:42,338
So what's going on? Why'd you
want to meet in private?

42
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:43,414
I need your help with a case.

43
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,683
Three antique coins were stolen

44
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,948
from my classics department at Columbia.

45
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,837
So why not ask Captain Holt
for help on the case?

46
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,385
Wait, are you guys getting a divorce?

47
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:50,971
I can handle it.

48
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:52,540
This doesn't bring up
any weird issues for me.

49
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:53,688
No, it's nothing like that.

50
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:54,891
Raymond's a brilliant detective.

51
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:56,264
It's just when a case involves me,

52
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,231
he can get a little overemotional.

53
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:00,914
- You remember the safe house.
- Oh, yeah, he went crazy.

54
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,550
But I also remember you and me
becoming best friends

55
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:04,260
and watching every Nic Cage
movie ever made.

56
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:06,788
- Can you still quote them all?
- No, I purged myself of that nonsense.

57
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:07,912
- Oh, I bet it's still in there.
- It's not.

58
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:08,856
- We'll see.
- We won't.

59
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:09,959
- There's a chance it's in there.
- Chance of zero.

60
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:11,389
I'd put money that maybe it's there.

61
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:12,939
- You're losing your money.
- Okay.

62
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:14,498
- So will you help me?
- I don't know.

63
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,868
I want to, but keeping
a secret from Holt?

64
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:16,927
- That's a lot of pressure.
- Hmm.

65
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:18,075
Am I remembering correctly?

66
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:20,367
Don't you... eat pressure for breakfast?

67
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:23,203
Nic Cage in "The Rock."

68
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:25,305
We are best friends. I am so in!

69
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,262
Oh, no, that's Raymond.

70
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:28,258
That's how he opens a door.

71
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:29,304
Kevin, are you still in here?

72
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,034
Uh, yes, Raymond, I'm in the stall.

73
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,382
Some tickets were just released

74
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,641
for Mahler's Fourth Symphony
this weekend.

75
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,176
Great. That sounds great. Let's do it.

76
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:38,300
Fantastic. Now, which section
do you prefer?

77
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:39,442
The first tier,

78
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,265
the second tier, the third tier...

79
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,246
The first tier.

80
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:44,914
Now, which section of the first tier?

81
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:49,750
Right, left, right center, center...

82
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:50,796
Just any section is fine.

83
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:52,176
Any section, wow.

84
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:53,766
Someone had pepper
on their eggs this morning.

85
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,735
I'll buy the tickets.

86
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,204
Any section.

87
00:02:58,506 --> 00:02:59,946
Guys, horrible news.

88
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:01,912
The fridge broke this morning.
Everything's warm.

89
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,247
Doesn't seem like that big a deal.

90
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,817
- Your yogurt's spoiled.
- Who did this?

91
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:06,728
Okay, everyone calm down.

92
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:08,575
I will put a request in
for a new fridge.

93
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,649
Good luck getting that approved.

94
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:10,955
Commissioner Kelly's already
slashed our budget

95
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,044
within an inch of its life.

96
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,963
Yeah, the toilet paper's
only one ply now.

97
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,744
- My butt hurts all the time.
- The AC is broken.

98
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,980
My butt hurts all the time.

99
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,416
Scully's butt hurts all the time.

100
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:19,464
All right, guys, we get it.

101
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,179
It's just that lunch
is the one part of the day

102
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:22,648
Commissioner Kelly hadn't ruined.

103
00:03:22,684 --> 00:03:24,595
People are pissed.
Morale's really taken a hit.

104
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,089
Okay, I got this.

105
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,590
Hey, squad. Lunch is on me today.

106
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,101
Taking everyone out for pizza.

107
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:33,204
And that's how you improve morale.

108
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,507
Okay. You're not the only
sergeant around here.

109
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:36,550
Let me help.

110
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,243
This side of the room, lunch is on me,

111
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:41,417
and we're getting something
better than pizza.

112
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,714
Sushi!

113
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:45,950
Are you trying to outdo me?

114
00:03:45,985 --> 00:03:47,091
No, no, no.

115
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:49,609
Just trying to raise morale.

116
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:51,790
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

117
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:54,361
Morale, morale, morale. Okay.

118
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,927
Wow, so this is your classroom.

119
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:58,094
What's today's lecture about?

120
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,763
I know you don't care about that.

121
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:00,898
Just ask me what you want to ask me.

122
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,229
Can I play with your laser pointer?

123
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:04,533
You know, the laser pointer
is a bit of a misnomer.

124
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:07,406
It is simply a laser.
The pointer is you.

125
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,740
- That was awesome.
- Take it for a spin.

126
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,975
Don't mind if I do.
Good afternoon, class.

127
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,845
Allow me to make my first... point.

128
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,980
- Very impressive.
- Thank you very much, Kevin.

129
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,949
But I do have five additional
points to make.

130
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:21,819
Chair, chair, wall, chair,

131
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:24,130
Captain Holt. Captain Holt? No.

132
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:27,723
Yes, that was a delicious lunch, Gary!

133
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:29,892
And I agree, our group does seem happier

134
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:31,198
than it was before.

135
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,479
Oh, the pizza was that good?

136
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:35,433
Pizza? Right, that's what
I said we were getting

137
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:37,968
before we decided to uh-snazz it up.

138
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,569
Oh, you guys snazzed?

139
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:42,372
Yeah, we snazzed all the way
to La Petite Creperie.

140
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,040
I thought we couldn't say "snazz."

141
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,409
Oh, no, I was thinking of [bleep].

142
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:47,677
We can't say [bleep]. Carry on.

143
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,379
Tell 'em how good it was, Rosa.

144
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,402
Tell 'em how high our morale is.

145
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:53,416
- High.
- Oh, stop gushing, girl.

146
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,956
I think it's so interesting

147
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,020
you guys didn't stick
to your original plan,

148
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:58,806
because neither did we.

149
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:00,231
What? Why?

150
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,105
Oh, you don't think we knew
you were gonna snazz?

151
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:05,127
We saw your snazz coming a mile away.

152
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:06,929
That's why I took my team out

153
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:09,398
for some big, juicy steaks, and...

154
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:10,933
♪ Mashed potatoes ♪

155
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:14,036
♪ And some spinach
and some key lime pie ♪

156
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,473
- Thank you, Heather.
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:16,907
Well, that doesn't sound
better than crepes.

158
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:18,040
It is. Terry wins.

159
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:19,876
We know. We were at both lunches.

160
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:22,144
How? They were simultaneous
and two miles apart.

161
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,980
It was free food. Life finds a way.

162
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:25,214
Okay, but you can't win

163
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:26,649
because it wasn't a competition.

164
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:27,683
So let's make it a competition.

165
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,068
Same groups tomorrow?

166
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:30,871
Okay, but let's agree at the end of this

167
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,439
- that we'll still be friends.
- No deal.

168
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:33,974
Good! 'Cause I didn't mean it anyway.

169
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:35,773
Hello, sir. How'd you find us out?

170
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:36,975
Mahler's Fourth Symphony.

171
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,659
He'd never sit in just any section.

172
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,062
I might. I'm flexible.

173
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:42,633
Oh, really? You'd sit center left?

174
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:44,357
In timpani alley?

175
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:46,146
I'll purchase those tickets right away.

176
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,008
No, don't! Fine.

177
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:54,376
Jake is helping me with a burglary

178
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:55,521
here at the university,

179
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:57,413
and I asked him not to tell you.

180
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:59,581
- Is this about St. Augustine?
- Yes.

181
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:00,849
- What's going on?
- He's embarrassed of me.

182
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:02,103
Last Christmas,

183
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,828
the classics department
threw a holiday party.

184
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,673
I had one drink too many
and utterly humiliated myself.

185
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,558
And that was the point
St. Augustine was making

186
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:10,759
in "Consolation of Philosophy."

187
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,837
Yeah, sounds super humiliating,

188
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,839
saying something smart.

189
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,297
Smart? I confused
St. Augustine with Boethius.

190
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:17,632
I might as well have stepped on a rake

191
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,133
and bonked myself on the forehead.

192
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:20,201
The problem wasn't what you said.

193
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,196
It was that Dean Allister
pointed out your mistake,

194
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:23,496
and you lost your damned mind.

195
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:26,239
I misremembered it because
I'm reading both simultaneously.

196
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,043
One book is too few for me.

197
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:29,044
Where is everyone going?

198
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,013
It was quite the kerfuffle.

199
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:34,315
The problem is, is that I get
flustered and defensive

200
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,509
because I know how they all see me:

201
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:40,121
as Kevin's working-class bimbo.

202
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,656
I can't imagine that's what they think.

203
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,796
- It is.
- Really?

204
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,165
Obviously I know that they're wrong,

205
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,812
but they put you in your own head,

206
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:46,922
and you're not yourself around them.

207
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,557
I'm sorry, I was just
trying to protect you.

208
00:06:48,593 --> 00:06:50,763
Yes, of course, thank you
for saving me from myself.

209
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,832
Now, if you'll excuse me,

210
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,359
I'll just go sit by the pool
and read some fiction...

211
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,990
like the bimbo that I am.

212
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,175
There's a pool here?

213
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,506
Sir, wait.

214
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,174
Oh! Wasn't expecting
to catch up to you so fast.

215
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,677
I don't know what to say now.
I thought I was gonna have

216
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:10,847
more running time
to formulate it. Oh, I know!

217
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:12,549
I'm sorry that we kept the
case a secret from you.

218
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:13,851
Oh, I understand why you did.

219
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:15,519
The truth is, ever since I met Kevin,

220
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:17,354
I've felt insecure in his world.

221
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,524
I can't compete with these
highly educated academics.

222
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,691
I worry every day

223
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:24,660
that I'll make one
St. Augustine slip too many,

224
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,904
and he'll realize...

225
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:29,134
- I'm beneath him.
- This is insane.

226
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,702
You're the smartest person I know.

227
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:32,903
I'll explain it to you.
Among Kevin's peers,

228
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:34,604
- I'm a Jake.
- No, no, no, no, no.

229
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,106
I refuse to live in a world
where you're the Jake,

230
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,502
because if you're the Jake,
what does that make me?

231
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:39,904
- The Charles?
- The Hitchcock.

232
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,101
The Hitchcock? Oh, my God.

233
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:44,613
You dropped down so many more
levels than I was expecting.

234
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,516
Okay, you know what? Screw this.

235
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,593
You are so smart,

236
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:48,928
and we're gonna prove it
to those professors.

237
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:50,130
You're gonna work this case,

238
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,700
and you're gonna find those coins.

239
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:55,024
Well, I suppose
it would be nice to show them

240
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,426
I'm more than just a hot,
dumb piece of ass.

241
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:58,928
Yes! That's the spirit.

242
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:00,296
Now get that hot ass moving,

243
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:01,530
'cause we've got a crime to solve.

244
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,165
Peralta, please, have some decorum.

245
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,633
What? I was just using your words.

246
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,368
Look, you teach people
the way you want to be treated.

247
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,525
That's what Dr. Phil says.

248
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,630
Okay, lunchtime starts in ten minutes.

249
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,640
Whichever team wins gets recorded

250
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:14,210
on the Whiteboard of Victory.

251
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,644
The winner will be decided
by our judges,

252
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,080
Hitchcock and Scully.

253
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:18,713
Oh, my God, are we
high status, Hitchcock?

254
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,515
- I think so.
- What a world.

255
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,617
Ah, well, good luck.

256
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:23,256
I'm sure you know
all the best places to eat

257
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:25,397
since you've reached
Elite status on Yelp.

258
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:26,706
Oh, wait, that was me.

259
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:27,774
Oh, because Yelp reviewers

260
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,381
are sane people with great taste?

261
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:32,060
Oh, sorry, couldn't hear you
over GourmetGlen12 saying

262
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,062
that my review of the duck skin
at the Hearth and Feather

263
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,497
was helpful.

264
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:38,567
Come on, Team Jeffords. It's chow time.

265
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,670
We have a cool thing to say too.

266
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:44,291
Team Santiago, let's lunch-a-bunch!

267
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:46,468
- No, I don't say that.
- Come on, Rosa, please?

268
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,009
Let's lunch-a-bunch.

269
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:49,210
Aha, Rosa said it!

270
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,712
Did you hear that? Did you hear it?

271
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:53,646
- Ah, Dean Allister?
- Policeman Raymond.

272
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:56,147
Good to see you.

273
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:58,217
Read any interesting magazines lately?

274
00:08:58,253 --> 00:08:59,786
This again? I was waiting for Kevin,

275
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,989
I had finished my book,
and I happened to glance

276
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:04,859
at an issue of "The Economist"
that someone left lying about.

277
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,896
All I remember is you becoming unhinged.

278
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:08,865
The only reason I
picked it up was to swat a fly.

279
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:10,068
I mean, I'm not crazy.

280
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:12,204
Why are there always flowers here?

281
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,075
So is policeman Raymond
joining the case?

282
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:16,577
Actually, he's leading it.

283
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:18,413
Captain Holt is the finest investigator

284
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,752
I've ever worked with.

285
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,614
Sir, tell him our plan of action.

286
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,617
- Clues.
- Okay, you're freezing up.

287
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,119
I'm just gonna take the wheel for now.

288
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,520
There were no signs of forced entry,

289
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,255
the only people with access
to the archives

290
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,556
were the professors in the department,

291
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:37,989
and they all have alibis, which means...

292
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,510
I don't know what you want me to say.

293
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,035
Okay, that's my fault
for throwing it to you again.

294
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:43,731
Which means we need to examine
the crime scene.

295
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,027
It is there that we will find

296
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:47,967
what Captain Holt has
so eloquently described as...

297
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:50,813
Clues?

298
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:52,173
Sir, you just said it.

299
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,641
Cupcakes up, everyone.

300
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,458
Heather, you already ate yours?

301
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:58,161
The point is to eat it in their faces.

302
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,283
- Honk, honk, bitches.
- What the hell?

303
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,604
We rented a party limo, drove
to Coney Island for hot dogs,

304
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,252
and then did karaoke the entire time.

305
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:09,471
I sang "It Wasn't Me"
by Shaggy. Crushed it.

306
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,891
But that's not even about lunch!

307
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,280
- It's...
- An experience.

308
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:13,681
- Team Amy wins.
- What?

309
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:15,618
How did you get there?
You were just with us.

310
00:10:15,654 --> 00:10:17,687
- Scully was with them.
- Free food.

311
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:19,724
Great cupcake, Sarge.

312
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,649
- But Amy still wins.
- Eat snazz, losers!

313
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:26,506
Okay, so there were no witnesses,

314
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,525
no cameras, and no prints.

315
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,194
In other words, we have nothing.

316
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:31,344
That's what you get when you
put a bimbo on the case.

317
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:33,513
Okay, well, let's not give up
all hope just yet.

318
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:34,663
We do know some things.

319
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,499
For example,
the perp entered using a key,

320
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,002
which means they probably work here.

321
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,604
And they knew enough to skip past

322
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,289
all these expensive-looking artifacts.

323
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:42,958
They walked straight up to this shelf

324
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:44,593
and grabbed the coin case from up there.

325
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:45,784
It's too high. You can't reach it.

326
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,720
Exactly. So now we know that the thief

327
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:48,971
was taller than me. That's a good lead.

328
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,740
Also, we know they were
a little bit of a freak,

329
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,599
since I am above average height
according to the 1940 census.

330
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,068
I didn't realize you had
a thing about your height.

331
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:57,502
I don't! Because I'm above average.

332
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:58,856
Why would I have a thing about my height

333
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,280
when I'm above average?
It doesn't make any sense.

334
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:03,675
Anyways, we're looking
for an insanely tall perp,

335
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,900
a real Shaq type.

336
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,513
Maybe the thief stood
on something, like...

337
00:11:07,548 --> 00:11:09,782
one of these drawers.

338
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:11,701
Turn off the light.

339
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:14,595
Maybe something will show up under UV.

340
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,277
- Bingpot!
- A footprint.

341
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:20,055
You did it, you brilliant bimbo.

342
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,259
Oh, there you are.
Why are you in the dark?

343
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,777
Were you not able to find
the light switch?

344
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:26,398
Ha-ha, very funny,
but I'll actually have you know

345
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:28,358
Captain Holt just found
a very promising lead.

346
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,815
Oh, how fun, a lead.

347
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,318
Meanwhile, we actually found the thief.

348
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:32,437
- You did?
- What?

349
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,124
Well, technically our janitor found him.

350
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,265
Come on in, Randy.

351
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:36,467
Tell them how you did their jobs.

352
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:38,642
Well, um, I was emptying the trash

353
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:40,116
in Professor Port's office.

354
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:42,979
I saw something shiny sticking
out from underneath a notepad.

355
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,892
It was one of the missing coins.

356
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,460
Great police work.

357
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,563
Perhaps you might want
to hire Randy, or...

358
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,934
Randy, you could hire them.

359
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,437
It seems like you all have
basically the same skill set.

360
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,651
We're actually all staffed up
in maintenance.

361
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:58,914
We don't want your job, Randy.

362
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:01,852
I know Dean Allister humiliated us,

363
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,354
but we can still have our revenge.

364
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,317
I watched a ton of horny '80s
comedies when I was a kid,

365
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:08,498
and they're filled with ways
of getting back at mean deans.

366
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:10,801
So we are gonna throw the wildest party

367
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:12,871
- this campus has ever seen.
- No.

368
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:14,273
Okay, then we'll have a bikini car wash.

369
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:15,876
No, no, save your schemes.

370
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:17,979
I know exactly how to get back
at the dean.

371
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:19,915
- By arresting him.
- For what?

372
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:21,284
It seems pretty obvious
that Port did it.

373
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,857
No, no, that makes no sense.

374
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:24,054
Why would someone
steal something valuable

375
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,242
and then leave it in their desk?

376
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,613
I feel like this is a veiled shot at me

377
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:27,771
for leaving the crown in my desk

378
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:28,740
during the third Halloween Heist.

379
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:29,758
- It is.
- Oh.

380
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:30,927
Allister planted the coin

381
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,709
in Professor Port's desk.

382
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,091
- They're rivals.
- Mm.

383
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,494
Did you see the book Allister
was holding back there?

384
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,426
A biography of Macedonian
general Parmenion.

385
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,659
He was taunting us.

386
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:41,990
Again, I'm the Hitchcock here.

387
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:43,476
You're gonna have to
connect the dots for me.

388
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,042
Parmenion was a close advisor
to Alexander the Great.

389
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,078
Alexander suspected that Parmenion

390
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,448
was trying to supplant him,
so he executed him.

391
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:52,218
He was getting rid of his rival.

392
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:55,098
Sir, you cracked it!
You and your big hard brain.

393
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:56,140
- Hard?
- Yes!

394
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,875
You have the biggest,
hardest brain on Earth,

395
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,066
and I want you to say it.

396
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:01,432
Say "I am Raymond Holt,
and my brain is rock hard."

397
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:02,690
A brain shouldn't be hard.

398
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:04,192
If anything, I'll say,
"I am Raymond Holt,

399
00:13:04,228 --> 00:13:05,861
and my brain is soft and wet."

400
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:07,663
No, don't say that.
It's gross and I hate it.

401
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:08,955
All right, let's go do some cop stuff.

402
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:10,547
_

403
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,150
Wait, why does Terry's team
have four wins?

404
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:15,986
He only won steaks, bowling,
and the mobile escape room.

405
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:17,754
You're forgetting about our breakfast

406
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:18,989
at the Empire State Building.

407
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,692
It was so cold up there.

408
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:23,129
It sounds a lot better than
our indoor skydiving lunch.

409
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,466
Speaking of which, are we gonna
get reimbursed for that?

410
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:28,031
How dare you complain
about the Funtastic FlyZone.

411
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,967
That was funtastic fun for everyone.

412
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:31,470
So what are you guys planning for today?

413
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,773
Oh, nothing much.

414
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:33,875
We're just gonna keep it "caszh."

415
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,944
Us too. Super "caszh."

416
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,381
Super duper "caszh."

417
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,316
We all know you're both planning

418
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,787
something insanely complicated
and annoying.

419
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,523
Your teammates are turning
against you, Terry.

420
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,326
- I'm on your team.
- Who cares?

421
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:49,857
We're gonna win.
Team Lunch-a-Bunch forever.

422
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:52,721
Sir, why are we still doing this?

423
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:54,023
We've been following him for days,

424
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:55,624
and he hasn't done anything suspicious.

425
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:56,823
Let's just confront him.

426
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:59,378
He only hid one of the stolen
coins in Port's desk.

427
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:00,696
He'll probably try to sell the others.

428
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:01,816
I want to catch him in the act.

429
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,258
Shh. Here he comes.

430
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,039
These college kids.

431
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:11,174
I used to wear long-sleeve T-shirts

432
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,426
under my short-sleeve T-shirts.

433
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:13,529
Wait a minute, I still could.

434
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:14,762
Hang on. He's stopping.

435
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:15,991
Oh, no, he forgot his phone.

436
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:17,572
He's gonna turn around and see us.
Come on.

437
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:20,399
- Sorry, sorry.
- Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

438
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:21,859
You want to join
our a cappella jam circle?

439
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:22,867
Oh, no.

440
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,736
Are you guys Harry Potter fans?

441
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:24,987
I do not like where this is going.

442
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:26,231
Three, four.

443
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:29,235
♪ Won't you come visit Hogwarts? ♪

444
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,161
♪ I'll be alone, dancing in Gryffindor ♪

445
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:38,273
♪ Harry is the best at the spells ♪

446
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,477
♪ And as for potions,
Hermione does well ♪

447
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,645
This is actually pretty funny.

448
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,493
You got to know Harry Potter.

449
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,991
Wait a minute. Where'd Allister go?

450
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:49,744
He was standing right here.

451
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:51,235
It's like he vanished without a trace.

452
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:53,572
Wrong, Peralta.
He vanished with a trace.

453
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:55,775
Check it out. His footprint. Gotcha.

454
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,534
I am Raymond Holt
and my brain is rock hard.

455
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,602
- I'm not going to say that.
- Smart.

456
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:01,160
Saving it for a bigger moment in front
of a bunch of people. Can't wait!

457
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:03,634
Okay, squad, hope you ate lunch already,

458
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,871
because it's lunchtime!

459
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,940
- What's with the getups?
- Oh, nothing much.

460
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:09,276
We just turned the parking garage

461
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,812
into an elaborate paintball arena.

462
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:13,448
It's zombie-themed. We hired 60 actors.

463
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:14,684
That sounds pretty expensive.

464
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,396
Nah, New York actors are desperate.

465
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:17,899
For ten bucks, you can
shoot 'em right in the face.

466
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:19,836
Wow, that's amazing.

467
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:22,909
I don't know how anybody
could ever beat that...

468
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:26,247
except maybe an in-office
teppanyaki grill.

469
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:27,481
Moshi moshi, losers!

470
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,547
We got shrimp. We got lobster.

471
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,450
Heather, I know you're
allergic to shellfish.

472
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:32,906
You're just gonna have to not eat.

473
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:36,238
Where's Heather? Where is everybody?

474
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,932
They're on the roof by Gina's statue.

475
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:40,797
- What the hell, guys?
- Oh, God, they found us.

476
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,800
- Don't let them take me.
- Why are you hiding from us?

477
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:45,298
This lunch competition
has gotten out of hand.

478
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,733
No one is having fun.

479
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:48,199
I keep having panic dreams

480
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:50,204
about Sergeant Santiago
shooting down my lunch ideas.

481
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:53,240
Historic walking tours
don't win lunch, Gary.

482
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,576
No one cares about winning lunch.

483
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:57,510
Please, just leave us alone.

484
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,246
Gary, wait. Look...

485
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:01,981
- Oh!
- Ow!

486
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:04,650
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God, it was an accident.

487
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:05,985
This thing doesn't have a safety.

488
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,980
Ow!

489
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:10,050
Ow, stop! Help!

490
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,620
And a big round of applause
for Janitor Randy

491
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:14,790
for recovering our precious coin.

492
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:16,894
Don't applaud for that man.

493
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,896
What's going on?

494
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:18,998
What's going on is,

495
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:20,767
Captain Holt just solved this case.

496
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:22,636
What's there left to solve?
We found the coin

497
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:24,406
in Professor Port's desk.
He's the thief.

498
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,674
Oh, you'd like everyone to believe that,

499
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,810
wouldn't you, Dean Allister?

500
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,646
Or should I say, General Parmenion?

501
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:31,525
Raymond, are you causing a kerfuffle?

502
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:33,728
Yes. Sometimes a moment
calls for a kerfuffle.

503
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:35,564
No. No moment calls for a kerfuffle.

504
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,501
You know my feelings on this.

505
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,070
Dean Allister framed Professor Port

506
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:40,305
to get rid of a rival,

507
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:43,020
just as Alexander got rid of Parmenion.

508
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:45,324
Preposterous. Do you even
have a shred of evidence

509
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,431
to back up that claim?

510
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:47,567
Oh, we've got more than a shred.

511
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:48,651
Look at these photos.

512
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:50,939
Here, a footprint
from the scene of the crime

513
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:52,429
left by the thief.

514
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:56,000
And here, another print
made yesterday by you.

515
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:58,203
- You've been caught, Allister!
- Is it happening?

516
00:16:58,238 --> 00:16:59,704
- Caught by me.
- It is happening.

517
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,874
- Me and my rock hard brain.
- It happened!

518
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,822
Oh, Raymond. Look around.

519
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,160
These shoes I'm wearing
with their "unique footprint"...

520
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:09,408
we all have them.

521
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:11,473
They were the departmental gift
this Christmas.

522
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:12,811
They're actually very funny.

523
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:14,680
They have Achilles printed on the heel.

524
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:16,817
I don't know if I would
call that "very" funny.

525
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:17,919
I'm surprised you didn't know
about them.

526
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,657
Kevin must have gotten a pair.

527
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,560
Oh, I remember what happened.

528
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:22,828
You had to leave the Christmas party

529
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:24,365
before they were handed out.

530
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:27,011
Why was that again?
Oh, yes. The kerfuffle.

531
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,880
But what about the
autobiography of Persimminons

532
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,123
you were taunting us with?

533
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,825
I suppose I can see how holding any book

534
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:33,395
would seem like a taunt to you.

535
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:34,912
- I own a book.
- But I don't think Raymond

536
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:36,075
is remembering the story correctly.

537
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,255
Alexander didn't see
Parmenion as a rival.

538
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,258
He killed him over a dispute
about his son.

539
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,772
Oh, no, it's Boethius all over again.

540
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:44,367
At least you got one thing right.

541
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:47,438
You do have a rock hard brain.
Because that's bad.

542
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,979
Everyone knows that a brain
should be soft and wet.

543
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:51,948
I wanted to say that,
but Jake told me not to.

544
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:54,474
Yeah, because it's gross.

545
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:57,479
There you are.

546
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,292
- You okay, sir?
- I'm fine.

547
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,960
I have decided to stop fighting it

548
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,495
and lean in to the fact
that I'm an idiot.

549
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,896
Look at me, playing a video game.

550
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,398
- Oh, which one?
- "Times" crossword app.

551
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,633
Not a video game.

552
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,771
It plays a little song
when you solve it,

553
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:12,240
as if you've just learned to potty.

554
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:15,773
Yes, yes, play me my dunce's tune.

555
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:19,410
Okay, so those guys look down
on you. So what?

556
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:21,211
I mean, Amy's parents look down on me.

557
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,072
They talk about me right in
front of my face in Spanish

558
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,358
because they don't think
I'm smart enough

559
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,452
to learn another language,

560
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:27,017
but I've been taking classes,

561
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,586
and now I can understand

562
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,420
all the hurtful things
they've been saying.

563
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:31,951
And how did that help?

564
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,438
Well, now I know they think I'm short

565
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:34,874
and I was able to do some research

566
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,208
and find that 1940s census

567
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:37,777
that proves I'm above average in height.

568
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,111
- For 1940.
- Yeah, I'm taller

569
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:40,780
than the greatest generation.
It doesn't matter.

570
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:43,149
The point is, you can use this.

571
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:45,173
There are benefits
to being underestimated.

572
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:48,770
My goodness. You're right.

573
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:51,236
There are benefits
to being underestimated.

574
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:53,496
You can get away with anything.

575
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:56,713
Sir? Are you going to kill the dean?

576
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:59,582
No. What if the thief
was someone we dismissed

577
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:01,150
because they didn't have
a classics background?

578
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:03,019
Someone who wasn't a professor?

579
00:19:03,054 --> 00:19:04,186
But what about the footprints?

580
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,993
The shoes were only given to faculty.

581
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:08,155
There was one pair that was
unaccounted for: Kevin's.

582
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,858
They were left at the party...

583
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,326
to be cleaned up.

584
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:12,895
By Janitor Randy!

585
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,947
My story solved it. I'm tall.

586
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:18,066
Hey, everyone, we would
like to say we're sorry

587
00:19:18,101 --> 00:19:20,168
for letting this competition
get the best of us,

588
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:21,614
and to make it up to you,

589
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:23,004
we figured out what to do for lunch.

590
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,239
Please, whatever your new idea is,

591
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:25,774
I just don't want to get shot again.

592
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,943
Ugh, Gary, it was
a paintball. Suck it up.

593
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:29,578
Isn't this supposed to be an apology?

594
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:32,113
Yes. You're right. I'm sorry.

595
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,716
I mean, I shot my husband with
a real bullet two years ago,

596
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,718
- and it comes up way less than this.
- Way less than this.

597
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:38,175
- Guys!
- Right.

598
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,755
What we're trying to say is
that we lost sight

599
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,558
of what this was all
really about: building morale.

600
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:45,726
So we bought two-ply toilet
paper for the whole squad.

601
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:47,194
- I call shotgun!
- Shotgun!

602
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,964
Also, I sold the teppanyaki grill

603
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:53,200
and used the money to turn
the briefing room into...

604
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,802
the lunch zone.

605
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:56,467
Oh, no. What's the lunch zone?

606
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:59,039
Is it someplace we have to put
on a harness and not eat lunch?

607
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,880
There are no harnesses.

608
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,879
There are phone chargers
and noise-canceling headphones.

609
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:07,281
So you can eat your lunch
and stare at your phone

610
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:09,917
and you won't have to see
or hear anyone you work with.

611
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,720
- It's perfect.
- It's... it's absolutely perfect.

612
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,921
We're so glad you like it.

613
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,157
And just to be sure,
I'm not gonna get shot.

614
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,277
Oh, my God, Gary.
Yes! You won't get shot!

615
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,328
Yeah, I stole those coins.

616
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:22,896
Can't believe you bought
that whole story.

617
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,731
They underestimated you, Randy,

618
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,633
just as they underestimated
Raymond Holt.

619
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:28,135
Well, you guys haven't been
that great to me either.

620
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,841
Well, you got to teach people

621
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:32,039
how you want to be treated,
Randy. Dr. Phil, RIP.

622
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,539
The point is, Captain Holt

623
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:34,784
solved the case when no one else could.

624
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,205
He's actually been stealing
from these archives for years.

625
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:38,705
You've been asleep
at the wheel, Allister.

626
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:39,960
- You're an embarrassment.
- Really?

627
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:41,162
Well, at least I've never confused

628
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,232
St. Augustine with Boethius.

629
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:45,818
Oh, who gives a rat's ass
about Boethius, Wesley?

630
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,098
What are you doing, Kevin?

631
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:49,035
- I am creating a kerfuffle.
- Oh, damn.

632
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:51,323
Sure, my husband is a hot piece of ass,

633
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,092
but he is so much more than just that.

634
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,762
Raymond Holt is as smart
as anyone in this department,

635
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,631
but he chooses to use his intelligence

636
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,972
to make our city a better place.

637
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,900
One day, I hope to live up to
the standard you set.

638
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:07,373
You make me want to have a wetter brain.

639
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:08,971
Oh, Kevin.

640
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,512
Y'all are hella specific.

641
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:17,977
