Ballsy.

First of all, it's not

just a frozen lasagna,

take 21 1/2 minutes.

Let's think.

The garlic bread needs

38

00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,542
in your teeth.

178
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,708
It's, uh,

179
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,708
quite off-putting.

180
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,042
- What? No.

181
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,042
"Time is running out."

182
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,667
I fed you your line.

183
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,375
No one ever has something

184
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,375
in their teeth in a movie.

185
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,042
Watch a movie,

186
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,042
stupid Holt.

187
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,542
- Damn it, I tried to remove

188
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,542
the server from the chain,

189
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,708
but the hacker

190
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,708
blocked the protocol.

191
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,458
- Why don't you

192
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,458
just unplug it?

193
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,708
That's what I do any time

194
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,708
I'm having computer trouble.

195
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,208
And also I code a lot.

196
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,208
Java, mainframe.

197
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,750
This guy knows

198
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,750
what I'm talking about.

199
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,083
- The NYPD servers have

200
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,083
internal backup batteries.

201
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,208
Even if we unplug them, they'll

202
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,208
stay on for another two hours.

203
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,083
- As a captain, I have an

204
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,083
override code I can use

205
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,333
to wipe the servers clean

206
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,333
so there'd be no information

207
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,417
for the hackers to steal,

208
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,417
but there's one problem, Jake.

209
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,833
- Yes, sir?

210
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,833
- You still have something

211
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,250
in your teeth.

212
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,250
You tried to get rid of it,

213
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,917
but it's made it

214
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,917
much more prominent.

215
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,583
- Why would you stop everything

216
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,583
just to tell me that?

217
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,417
- It's very distracting.

218
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,417
Anyway, I can't use

219
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,667
my override code,

220
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,667
because doing so would delete

221
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,667
the entire evidence

222
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,667
tracking database.

223
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,833
The NYPD only backs up

224
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,833
that information

225
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,542
at the precinct level

226
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,542
twice a year.

227
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,583
We would lose four months

228
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,583
of evidence.

229
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,417
- So what you're saying

230
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,417
is that every perp

231
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,083
awaiting trial

232
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,083
would walk free?

233
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,250
- Exactly, and we have

234
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,250
hundreds of open cases.

235
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,750
Wiping the servers

236
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,750
is not an option.

237
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,583
The only solution

238
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,583
is to track down the hacker.

239
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,792
- How? It could be anywhere

240
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,792
in the world--

241
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,917
Osaka, Berlin,

242
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,917
Macau, Stockholm.

243
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,583
Are you guys just gonna

244
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,583
keep letting me list cities

245
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,542
I've lived in?

246
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,542
- Wait, the LACMI server

247
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:19,292
isn't wired to the internet.

248
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:19,292
It's supposed to be offline.

249
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,792
How are they accessing it?

250
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,708
- They must be going

251
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,708
through a physical AP.

252
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,417
- Again, these guys don't get

253
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,417
computers like you and I, so--

254
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,917
- It's not

255
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,917
a remote connection.

256
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,583
The hacker's inside

00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,583

258
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,250

And, Jake.

264
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,250

265
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,125
It's on another tooth now.

266

Is it somehow on my face?

267
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,292
- No, what I was

268
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,292
going to say is, we only have

269

15 minutes left.

270
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,542
You need to focus,

They're all so mean.

I'm sure they're

351
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,542
Don't solve it without me.

352
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,833
- I got the keys.

353
00:05:58,542 --> 00:05:59,833
Let's go.

354
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,708
Jocelyn.

355
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,708
- Jocelyn Pryce, hey.

356
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,875
- What are you doing here?

357
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,792
Shouldn't you be

358
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,792
at the airport?

359
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,833
- Yeah, uh, I wanted to stop

360
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,833
and see you on the way there.

361
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,875
I think we need to talk.

362
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,875
- Why? Is something wrong?

363
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,708
- I should've done this last

364
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,708
night, but I chickened out.

365
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,500
We need to break up.

366
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,083
- Ugh.

367
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,083
Mama Magglione.

368
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:21,917
.

369
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,417
- You want to break up?

370
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,042
But I just met

371
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,042
your college friends.

372
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:26,583
Are you telling me I had

373
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:26,583
to talk to Matt for nothing?

374
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,750
- Rosa.

375
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,750
- I thought you liked Matt.

376
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,750
- Matt is a nightmare.

377
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,750
He kept saying

378
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,917
"hashtag tell me

379
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,917
about it."

380
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,083
- We should really get going.

381
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,250
- Listen, I just

382
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,250
don't understand

383
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,375
why this is happening.

384
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,750
- Look, I love being with you,

385
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,917
but how often

386
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,917
am I actually with you?

387
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,583
- We're together every night.

388
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,583
- Unless you're at work,

389
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,667
or doing work,

390
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,667
or thinking about work.

391
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,333
It's like you never

392
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,333
have time for me.

393
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,000
- I'm sorry, but Rosa

394
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,000
doesn't have time for you.

395
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,542
We have a really

396
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,542
important work thing.

397
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,250
That was bad.

398
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,250
Let me try rephrasing it.

399
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,583
You are not as important

400
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,583
as Rosa's job.

401
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,083
Oh, wow.

402
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,083
That was way worse.

403
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,583
- Look, we just have to take

404
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,583
care of this one thing.

405
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,583
It's an emergency.

406
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,583
Then I'll be right back

407
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,917
and we can talk about this.

408
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,042
- I really have

409
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,042
to get to the airport.

410
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:59,125
- Please.

411
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:59,125
- Okay, fine.

412
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,958
But I'm leaving

413
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,958
in 10 minutes.

414
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,958
- Okay, just wait

415
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,958
in the break room.

416
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,208
Don't sit on the couch.

417
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,208
It's full of farts.

418
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,042
- You okay?

419
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,042
- Yeah, I'm great.

420
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,625
I love being dumped.

421
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,625
It's super great.

422
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,250
- I think you're

423
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,250
being sarcastic,

424
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,417
but it's hard to tell with your

425
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,417
voice the way it always is.

426
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,292
- We just checked the third

427
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,292
floor. We didn't find anyone.

428
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,292
- We're on our way to one.

429
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,292
- You didn't even start yet?

430
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,792
- Rosa took a long

431
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,792
time getting ready.

432
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,208
You know how ladies

433
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,208
be preppin'.

434
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,625
Ow! I was just

435
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,625
covering up the truth

436
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,292
so it wouldn't

437
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,292
be awkward.

438
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,292
- Ooh, did something

439
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,292
awkward happen?

440
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,125
I can probably relate.

441
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,125
Dish, bish.

442
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,958
- Rosa got dumped

443
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,958
out of the blue

444
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,542
because she cares so much

445
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,542
about her job and doesn't spend

446
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:32,792
enough time with Jocelyn.

447
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,375
Ow! There's no winning

448
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,375
with you.

449
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,000
- Oh, so you got dumped,

450
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,000
and you didn't see it coming.

451
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,167
Oh, brother,

452
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,167
you are in Boyle Country.

453
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,833
Here's what you're

454
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,833
gonna want to do.

455
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,500
- Come on, Boyle.

456
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,500
- Beg her to take you back,

457
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,208
and don't be afraid to cry.

458
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,208
I'm talking tears and snot.

459
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,333
- Quinn, did you

460
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,333
get the alert?

461
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,958
- Yeah, but I haven't seen

462
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,958
anyone unusual down here.

463
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,083
I mean, other than 1,000

464
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,083
Kappa Gamma Kappas.

465
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,292
- At least you didn't

466
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,292
have to deal with Lambda Nus.

467
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,500
Those girls are savages.

468
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,292
- Right? We're

469
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,292
the victims here.

470
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,833
We have a nighttime event, and

471
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,833
if we don't make our blowouts,

472
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,333
then we'll all

any money to the kids,

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
the charity is.

478
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,167
- It's to buy shoes for poor

479
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,167
people so they can get jobs.

480
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,833
- Yeah.

481
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,833
- We'll do our best,

482
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,500
but it's possible

483
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,500
you're gonna miss your event.

484
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,167
- That's too bad, 'cause you

485
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,167
could use some decent shoes.

486
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,792

487
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,792
these at Aldo.

488
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:20,167
- Was it buy one, get one?

489
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:20,167
- No, it wasn't.

490
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,125
It was a three-for-one

491

Labor Day doorbuster.

492
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,375
- Makes sense.

- Come on.

- Three is clear.

497
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,125
We're finishing up two.

00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,708
I gotta get out of here

499
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,000
before the sorority girls

500
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,000
notice my tie.

501
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000

502
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000

- Hitchcock, damn it.

506
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,208
I meant to call Peralta.

507
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,875
We're in the middle

508
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,875
of a crisis.

509
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,667
- Oh, no. Is it the lasagna?

510
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,667
- The what?

511
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,708

00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,708
with me, Raymond.

513
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,208
What's wrong

with the lasagna?

you're talking about.

with the lasagna?

519
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,042
Is it bubbling over?

524
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,375
- I don't have time

525
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,375
for these shenanigans.

526
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,208
- What's the problem?

527
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,208
- He wouldn't say.

528
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,625
- Oh, no.

529
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,625
Then it must be bad.

530
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,500
Call Jake.

531
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,500
He'll tell us the truth.

532
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,083
[line trills]

533
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,917
- Hitchcock?

534
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,917
- Give it to us straight, man.

535
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,167
- What's going on?

536
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:06,167
- Uh, just searching

537
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,917
the first floor.

538
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,917
- Searching the first floor?

539
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,750
- Why is the lasagna

540
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,750
on the first floor?

541
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,250
- Why is the lasagna

542
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,250
on the first floor?

543
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,917
- What? Are you talking about?

544
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,917
The lasagna is fine.

545
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,917
- Oh, thank God.

546
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,917
He says it's fine.

547
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,250
Oh, you're a saint, Jakey.

548
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,250
I love you.

549
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,917
- Okay. Holt's texting me.

550
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,917
Love you, too.

551
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,583
Rosa!

552
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,583
We gotta go up to Holt's.

553
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,917
- Is this not done yet?

554
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,917
Ugh.

555
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,375
Jocelyn leaves

556
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,375
in eight minutes,

557
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,583
and I don't want things

558
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,583
to end like this.

559
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,875
- Wow.

560
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,875
Way to be vulnerable.

561
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,208
I thought for sure

562
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,208
you'd write her off

563
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,417
the second she said

564
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,417
she wanted to break up.

565
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,917
- Yeah, I did.

566
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,917
She's dead to me.

567
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,083
- Wait? Then why

568
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,083
are you so anxious

569
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,083
to get back up and

570
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,083
talk to her?

571
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,167
- Because I have a plan.

572
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,417
I'm gonna beg her to stay,

573
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,042
change whatever it is

574
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,042
I need to change,

575
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,167
then once our relationship

576
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,167
is stronger than ever,

577
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,375
I'm gonna dump her ass

578
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,375
so quick.

579
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,083
It's gonna be brutal.

580
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,750
- Okay, I'm gonna try

581
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,750
and put this nicely.

582
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,292
That is psychotic.

583
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:47,917
Okay, maybe not psychotic,

584
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:47,917
but it's like something

585
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,458
the lady

586
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,458
from "Killing Eve" would do.

587
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,292
Not Sandra Oh, Villanelle.

588
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,292
You know, the crazy one

589
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,792
who stabs everyone

590
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,792
with her hairpin.

591
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,292
But--have you still

592
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,292
not watched "Killing Eve"?

593
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,792
I've told you about it

594
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,792
so many times.

595
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:56,958
- Look, I've never

596
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:56,958
lost a breakup,

597
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,292
and I'm not starting now.

598
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,292
I'm 12-0.

599
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,458
I'm always the dumper,

600
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,458
never the dumpee.

601
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,750
- I just don't think

602
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,750
every breakup

603
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,125
has a winner and a loser.

604
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,625
- Sounds like somebody

605
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,625
who's lost all his breakups.

606
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,208
- [scoffs]

607
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,208
Not all.

608
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,083
Maybe like half, max.

609
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,083
Just--being generous.

[phone rings]

611
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,625
- Hey, Ames.

612
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,625
- Cab was too slow.

613
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,625
Decided to walk.

614
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,125
It's nice to take

615
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,125
a little stroll.

616
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,125
You're clearly running

617
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,125
at full speed.

618
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,458
- Whatever.

619
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,958
How's it going there?

620
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,958
- Not great.

621
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,458
We still haven't found

622
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,458
the hacker.

623
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,958
- Oh, super.

624
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,958
I mean--oh, no.

625
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,083
- Is Amy FOMOWing?

626
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,083
- Of course not.

627
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,708
- Big time.

628
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,208
Okay, I gotta go, babe.

629
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,208
We're headed to Holt.

630
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,583
- Don't you dare

631
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,583
hang up on me!

632
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,833
I am part of this.

633
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,625
- Rosa, this is dumb.

634
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,625
I'm just gonna go.

635
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,917
- No, no, no.

636
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,917
You promised me more time.

637
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,167
I still have

638
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,167
seven minutes.

639
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,250
- I really don't

640
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,250
want to miss my flight,

641
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,417
and I cannot

642
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,417
physically stand

643
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,917
the way that room

644
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,917
smells anymore.

645
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,333
- Just breathe

646
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,333
through your mouth.

647
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,250
Please, just stay here.

648
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,250
I'll be right back.

649
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,667
- We searched everywhere.

650
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,500
No hacker.

651
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,500
- Maybe he camouflaged himself.

652
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,167
Maybe he's a real-life

653
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,167
Peeta Mellark, out there

654
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,000
looking like a river rock.

655
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,000
- I hate to say it,

656
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,458
but maybe it's time

657
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,458
we start thinking

658
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,000
about erasing the server.

659
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,000
- No, not until

660
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,167
the last possible minute.

661
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,333
What else can you do?

662
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,833
- I've been trying

663
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,833
to pinpoint him.

664
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,667
I've been making my way

665
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,667
through the server sockets,

666
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,167
trying to determine which port

667
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,167
he's plugged into.

668
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,292
- What's going on?

669
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,292
I can't hear anything.

670
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,667
Turn me around.

671
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,667
I'm missing everything.

672
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,667
Part of the team.

673
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,667
What's up, team?

674
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,167
- Is Sergeant Santiago

675
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,167
suffering from FOMOW?

676
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,042
- No.

677
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,042
- [mouths words]

678
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,500
[distant commotion]

679
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,500
- What's happening?

680
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,292
- I think the hacker just

681
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,292
opened the holding cell.

682
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,542
[women chattering indistinctly]

683
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,542
- Mama Magglione.

684
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,167
.

685
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,875
- Oh, no.

686
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:20,875
They're running free.

687
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,792
- Everyone, cover up

688
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,792
your worst physical attributes.

689
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,000
- It's no use.

690
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,458
They could always

691
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,458
find new ones.

692
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,875
- Why would the hacker

693
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,875
open the holding cell?

694
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,708
- Maybe he's trying

695
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,708
to create a distraction.

696
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,292
I think he can see that I'm

697
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,292
closing in on his location.

698
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,000
- Then keep doing that.

699
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,000
The rest of you,

700
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,333
get them back

701
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,333
into holding.

702
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,375
- Oh, come on.

703
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,375
Get down from there.

704
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,542
- Do you know who my father is?

705
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,542
He's in business.

706
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,542
That's where you actually

707
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,542
make money at your job.

708
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,458
- I make money.

709
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,458
I make good money.

710
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,958
- That can't be true.

711
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,708
Otherwise, you wouldn't

712
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,708
still have that chin.

713
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,458
- What? Nobody ever said

714
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,458
anything about my chin?

715
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,083
Boyle, is something wrong

716
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,083
with Terry's chin?

717
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,333
- I don't want to get involved.

718
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,333
- Oh, my God. It's true.

719
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,750
- How is she running so fast

720
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,750
in those shoes?

721
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,333
- She's too drunk

722
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,333
to feel any pain.

723
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,583
- Open up.

724
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,583
- No.

725
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,917
- You are trapped in a very

726
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,917
small room, and we can see you.

727
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:03,083
What's your plan here?

728
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,250
- Shut up, I'm trying to think.

729
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,583
If you come in here,

730
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,917
I'll bite you with this

731
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,917
weird mouth thing.

732
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,208
- That is a staple remover,

733
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,333
and it's shocking

734
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,333
you don't know that.

735
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,083
- Sorry, I'm not

736
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,083
a secretary.

737
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,417
- I don't have time

738
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,417
for this.

739
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,000
My girlfriend leaves

740
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:16,000
in three minutes.

741
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,250
You are ruining

742
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,250
my life.

743
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,500
- You're ruining

744
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,500
my life.

745
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,750
I missed my

746
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,750
Drybar appointment

747
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,667
without calling

748
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,667
to cancel first.

749
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,500
They keep record

750
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,500
of those things.

751
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,875
- Oh, my God, neither of your

752
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,875
lives are being ruined.

753
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,333
I told you I'm not on board

754
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,333
with your psycho plan

755
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,917
to destroy

756
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,917
your girlfriend.

757
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:32,917
- I'm not gonna destroy her.

758
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:32,917
I actually want her back.

759
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,458
- I really love her, Jake.

760
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,917
- What? Rosa, then why'd you

761
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,917
say all that stuff

762
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,458
about winning

763
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,458
the breakup?

764
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,958
- Because it's weak and

765
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,958
humiliating to love someone.

766
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,625
I lied to make myself

767
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,625
feel strong and normal.

768
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,458
- Right, that's definitely

769
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,458
what came across,

770
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,917
how normal

771
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,917
you were being.

772
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:44,917
[door opens]

773
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:46,792
- Don't let her go.

774
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,958
You guys, I used to have

775
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,958
this boyfriend, Jason,

776
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,042
then we broke up 'cause

777
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,042
I got drunk at Spring Fling

778
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,583
and passed out in a bush, and

779
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:54,583
he took too long to find me,

780
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,125
and now he's gone

781
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,125
and it's like,

782
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,375
there's no one to find me

783
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,375
when I pass out in a bush.

784
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,417
- I'm not sure

785
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,417
that totally applies here.

786
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,375
- No, she's right.

787
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,625
I can't let Jocelyn go.

788
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,958
Can you handle this

789
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,958
without me?

790
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,458
- Yeah, it's under control.

791
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,750
Go get Jocelyn back.

792
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,417
- Jocelyn Pryce.

793
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,417
- Do you need to use a phone

794
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,417
to make a call?

795
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,792
- Gross, I don't know

796
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,792
any phone numbers.

797
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,250
- Where the hell

798
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,250
did Jocelyn go?

799
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,792
- Elevator.

800
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,792
Tears and snot.

801
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
- [grunts]

802
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
- [scoffs]

803
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
Where are you going?

804
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,000
I still have one minute left.

805
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,458
- I'm leaving because

806
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,458
it's clearer to me than ever

807
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,625
that your job is more important

808
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,625
to you than I am.

809
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
- That's not true!

810
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,083
- Sorry, ma'am, I can't

811
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,083
let anyone in or out.

812
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,958
- She's with me.

813
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,833
- You don't even apologize

814
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,833
blow me off.

815
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,250
You just text

816
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,250
"Double homicide TTYL".

817
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,750
- Sometimes I add

818
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,750
those little heart emojis.

819
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,417
You know how uncomfortable

820
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,417
that is for me.

821
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,083
I'm sorry.

822
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,083
My job is hard.

823
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,000
- Yeah, it is, and it's

824
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,000
important, and you help people,

825
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,792
but I need more.

826
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,833
- I promise I'll try.

827
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,500
- Honestly, I just don't

828
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,500
see it changing.

829
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,708
- Move, move, move!

830
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,958
Oh, no,

831
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,958
why are you outside?

832
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,708
Is it over?

833
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,708
Did we catch the hacker?

834
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,208
- No, I have a personal thing

835
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,208
that's more important to me.

836
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:05,375
- Oh, yeah, work-life balance.

837
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:05,375
I have that, too.

838
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,375
- Sorry, I can't--

839
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,375
- Andrew, it's me!

840
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,458
Come on, come on, come on.

841
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:12,958
- Got it.

842
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,000
- What?

843
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,208
- Time check.

844
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,208
- Five minutes, ten seconds.

845
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,708
- It's over.

846
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,708
- Don't say that.

847
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,167
- We'll never get the garlic

848
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,167
bread toasted in time.

849
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,542
- We can, and we will.

850
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,542
- How?

851
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:21,792
- We'll set the oven to 500.

852
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,208
- Are you insane?

853
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:23,208
It'll burn.

854
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,542
- We'll wrap it

855
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,542
in foil.

856
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:25,875
- The foil will stick

857
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:25,875
to the cheese.

858
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,667
- That's a risk

859
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,667
we'll have to take.

860
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,708
- Move it.

861
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,208
- Hey, you made it.

862
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,208
- Yeah.

863
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,333
- We finally got all the

864
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,333
Lambda Nus back into holding.

865
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
- Who are

866
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
the Lambda Nus?

867
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,250
Doesn't matter.

868
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,250
I'll read your notes later.

869
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,708
- I didn't take any notes.

870
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,750

And Knox could tell that.

So he knew that

we wouldn't catch on

we can't find the hacker

is because

is to just trick Holt

he's a criminal.

Why am I doing that part?

Send.

1048

Okay, it said delivered.

you'll be happy to know

erase the server.

00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,167
- Oh, thank God.

1055
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,917
- But sad to know

1056
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,917
that Knox caught on

1057
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,750
and is now

1058

holding me at gunpoint.

1059
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,750
- Why not lead with that?

1060
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,250
- Nobody has to get hurt.

1061
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,917
Just put your guns down,

1062
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,917
and put your hands in the air.

1063

- Hey! I said

1064
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,083
put your guns down,

1065
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,125
and get your hands

1066
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,125
in the air.

1067
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,583
- The bread,

1068
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,583
it's gonna burn.

1069

- Guys, do what he says.

1070
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,625
I'll buy you all

1071

the garlic bread you want.

to that, Sarge.

1074
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,792
- Knox, you're pointing a gun

1075
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,792
at an NYPD captain.

1076
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:20,917
Have you really thought

1077
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:20,917
this through?

1078
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,125
- This is not my fault.

1079
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,625
You were supposed to be

1080
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,625
at the dentist.

1081
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,917
- What?

1082
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,917
How did you...

1083
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:26,917
You called me.

1084
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,292
He called me.

1085
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,125
He said he had a tip

1086
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,125
for the officer in charge

1087

of the Avery murder.

1088
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,292
I said I could meet any time

1089
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,792
except for this morning

1090
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,792
because of the dentist.

1091
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,125
- I had it

1092
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,125
all planned out.

1093
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,458
- Guess you didn't count

1094
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,458
on my FOMOW.

1095
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,708
Yeah, that's right.

1096
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,708
It's crippling.

1097
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,958
- Oh, picking a weird time,

1098
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,125
but I'm glad

1099
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,125
you're finally owning it.

1100

- Here's what's

1101
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,625
gonna happen.

1102
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,208
The captain and I are gonna

1103
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,208
walk out of here real slow.

1104
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,833
No one's gonna

1105
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,833
move a muscle.

1106
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,958
Everyone's gonna be okay.

1107
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,250
Now we're just gonna move.

1111
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,500
We got him.

1112
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,792
- Jeffords, get him

into holding.

1114
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:59,083
- With pleasure.

1115

You're about to have

1116
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,458
a really bad day.

1117
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,333
Give me that.

Look at his pants, ladies.

They're relaxed fit.

Uh-oh.

Is that a braided belt?

You know what, forget it.

1124
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,833
I'll just read Amy's notes.

1125

on your way to the airport?

1127

but it's worth it.

1129

It means a lot that Rosa bailed

1130
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,083
on all this just for me.

1131
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,958
- Aww.

1132
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,958
- You did what, Diaz?

1133
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,375
- Now, sir, I told her

1134
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,375
it was okay.

1135
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,875
If you're gonna be mad

at anyone, be mad at me.

1137

00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,333
No.

1141
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,875
I didn't think you

1142
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,875
were really gonna be mad.

1143
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,375
That's--that backfired.

1144
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,375
Be mad at Rosa.

1145

- Worst morning ever.

1146
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:41,958
- Yeah, it was stressful,

1147
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:41,958
but we got the guy.

1148

are taking it so hard.

- Come on.

1155
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,542
- Look at this bread.

1156
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:48,708
It's completely inedible.

1157
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,125
There's not even

1158
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,125
any soft parts

1159

Nothing!

1165

- Okay.

1166
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,667
But have you

1167

ever considered

Never done that before.

1172

- I guess maybe

1173
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,833
we could give it a try.

- What the hell.

1177
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,250
I had a feeling

1178
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,250
something crazy

1179
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,667
was gonna happen today.

Mmm.
