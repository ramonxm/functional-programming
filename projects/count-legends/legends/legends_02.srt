1
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:05,930
So,

2
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:07,932
two keys, huh?

3
00:00:07,956 --> 00:00:09,500
That's a lot of snow.

4
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:10,701
And if you can't handle it,

5
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,436
we're happy to find someone who can.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,505
Don't worry about me, friend.
I can handle it.

7
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,173
Marissa, baby,

8
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:17,742
go get our guests
something to drink, would you?

9
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:19,443
- We don't want a drink.
- What is this, a social call?

10
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:20,696
- It's not a tea party.
- We look like

11
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:22,680
- five-year-old girls to you?
- Gentlemen, please.

12
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:24,415
Have some patience.

13
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,183
Two keys.

14
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:27,885
Pure as a Catholic schoolgirl.

15
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:29,620
Did you bring the cash?

16
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,522
Oh, we brought something
much better than cash.

17
00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:32,890
- What is that?
- Our guns!

18
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:34,425
NYPD! You're under arrest!

19
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,537
Boss man's gone. Where'd he go?

20
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,742
Thank you kindly, little lady.

21
00:00:58,306 --> 00:00:59,717
Gio Costa,

22
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:01,452
you're under arrest.

23
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:02,820
You want that drink now, Hitchcock?

24
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:04,221
Don't mind if I do, Scully.

25
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:05,656
Don't mind if I do.

26
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:26,799
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

27
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:33,484
What the hell, Diaz?

28
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:35,352
You trying to make your heart explode?

29
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:36,754
I'm loading up on coffee
because it's a pain in the ass

30
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:37,955
getting to the kitchen now,

31
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,023
and I don't want to come back here.

32
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:40,591
Is this about the desks?

33
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,927
Yes, Terry, it's about the desks.

34
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:44,762
How long is Commissioner Kelly
going to punish us

35
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:46,697
because Captain Holt complained
about him to the mayor?

36
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:48,332
I don't know, but I hope it ends soon.

37
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:50,468
Terry's shoulders weren't built
for tight spaces.

38
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:52,002
It's bonk city in here!

39
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:53,437
I've said "excuse me"
more times this morning

40
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,439
than I have in my entire life.

41
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:56,774
Twice!

42
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:01,378
- Jake.
- Rosa.

43
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:06,617
Good morning.

44
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:07,952
Oh, my. We are very close together.

45
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:09,386
I love it. Hey,

46
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,387
you know how I've always wanted

47
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,388
to have another child?

48
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:12,723
Well, it's happening!

49
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:13,958
Genevieve is pregnant?

50
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:15,459
But I thought your "meh-err"

51
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:16,894
no longer made "whoo-oo."

52
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:18,963
Correct.
My testes no longer make sperm.

53
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,631
I was good with "meh-err"
and "whoo-oo."

54
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:21,699
No, we're thinking of adopting again.

55
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:23,000
We just got an email

56
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:24,902
from Nikolaj's 15-year-old brother

57
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:26,370
in Latvia that he's never met.

58
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:28,038
Yeah, his name is Dragomir.

59
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,540
Oh, my God.

60
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:31,575
That is a 42-year-old fur trapper.

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,310
What? You don't see the resemblance?

62
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:35,746
Yeah, to Matisyahu.
There's no way he's 15.

63
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,348
Well, then, how come he wrote
that his greatest fear

64
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,316
is "going through puberty"?

65
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,518
Probably because
he wants you to think he's 15

66
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,685
so you'll adopt him.

67
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:42,887
Look, Charles, I hate to say this,

68
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,488
but I think this guy is scamming you.

69
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:45,723
Come on. You're just suspicious

70
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:47,024
- of everyone.
- Jake!

71
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,492
Charles!

72
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,094
Captain wants to see you!

73
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:52,730
I cannot get through
this room anymore,

74
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:54,331
so I'm yelling everything now.

75
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:56,734
Nancy, Captain said you can

76
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,769
go to your psychologist this morning.

77
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,838
You're clear! Get your head right.

78
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:02,740
Gentlemen, we have a situation.

79
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:04,742
Scully and Hitchcock just got
a call from Internal Affairs.

80
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:07,545
They're interested
in a case of theirs from 1986.

81
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,347
If you ask me, this old case
is only coming up now

82
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:11,749
because the commissioner is trying

83
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,617
to drum up a scandal in the Nine-Nine.

84
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,786
And take out your two
best detectives in the process.

85
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,921
You're not my two best detectives.

86
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:18,522
Oh, that's such a relief.

87
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:19,757
I feel so much safer now.

88
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,559
- Good lord.
- Don't interfere

89
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,093
with IA's investigation. Just find out

90
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:24,762
what actually happened

91
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:26,630
in case Kelly is trying
to manipulate the facts.

92
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:27,728
Can you do that?

93
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,099
Oh, so you're asking
if we can open a portal

94
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,701
to the wet and wild 1980s

95
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:31,969
to investigation the bizarre lives

96
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:33,571
of these magnificent dodos?

97
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:35,539
I believe it was a young Barack Obama

98
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:38,075
who said "Uh, yes, we can."

99
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,977
Ooh, sorry. Sorry.

100
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,379
Sorry. You want to see me, sarge?

101
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:43,581
Yeah. I know we're all

102
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:45,049
sort of crammed together in here,

103
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,717
but we were kind of thinking

104
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,152
that your uniformed officers

105
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:49,987
are, uh, causing some problems.

106
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:51,589
Oh? Like what?

107
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,057
How do I put this tactfully?

108
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,725
Your squad turned the kitchen
into a cesspool,

109
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,960
nastied up the bathroom,
and made the elevator

110
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,461
smell like a hundred butts.

111
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:59,396
Okay, thank you for your tact, Diaz.

112
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,965
Well, that's unfair.
Your squad is responsible

113
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,100
for at least 50 of those butts.

114
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:04,602
Look, all I'm saying is maybe

115
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:05,736
you can ask the downstairs people

116
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,737
- to be more...
- Excuse me?

117
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,405
"Downstairs people"?

118
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:10,140
That's a little offensive.

119
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,409
Oh, don't get it twisted.

120
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,911
It's just where you came from.

121
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:15,779
Some of my best friends
are downstairs people.

122
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:19,516
Okay, I think you know
exactly what that sounds like,

123
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,652
you upstairs people.

124
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:23,153
Oh, thank you
for that nice compliment.

125
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:24,688
It wasn't a compliment,
and you know it!

126
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:25,856
I said it with 'tude.

127
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,658
Classic downstairs person.

128
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:31,095
Wow, you are prejudiced
against the first floor.

129
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:33,530
I'm taking this up the chain.

130
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:35,766
Gina Linetti spaghetti confetti.

131
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,768
Gina Linetti spaghetti confetti.

132
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,603
- Faster.
- GinaLinettispaghetticonfetti.

133
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:40,938
- Captain Holt.
- Uh, yeah, can't you see

134
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:42,039
we're in the middle of something?

135
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,607
Sorry. It sounded like you were

136
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,542
just saying gibberish back and forth.

137
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:46,944
Gina is helping me to prepare
for a televised interview.

138
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,479
Since the mayor has yet

139
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:49,813
to weigh in on Commissioner Kelly's

140
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:51,482
"Vigilant Policing" initiative,

141
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:52,616
I've decided to take my objections

142
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,951
straight to the people.

143
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,487
And this gibberish
is actually Gina jargon,

144
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:58,188
a world-renowned linguistic system

145
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:00,157
that worked pretty well
for Ellen Musk.

146
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:02,126
- Elon Musk.
- Ellen Musk.

147
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,195
Season one winner
of VH1's "Queen Bitch."

148
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:06,830
Sir, isn't going to the press

149
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,465
going to make Kelly
even angrier at us?

150
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:11,061
Yeah. He's already made
life here pretty miserable.

151
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,972
The crowding, the desks, the
downstairs people treating the bullpen

152
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,573
like a dumpster.

153
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:19,710
Ooh, I'm so sorry
for the untidiness, milord.

154
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:20,811
That's enough. I don't have time

155
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:22,046
for your internecine battles,

156
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,180
and I don't give a hoot

157
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:24,848
about your minor inconveniences.

158
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:26,817
I am trying to fight injustice

159
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:30,020
and do what is right
for the entire NYPD.

160
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:31,588
Understood?

161
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:34,525
Yes, milord.

162
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,827
Okay, let's set the scene.

163
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,228
The year is 1986.

164
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:39,997
"Top Gun" is crushing the box office,

165
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:41,699
and the Beastie Boys
have just been issued

166
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,734
- their "License to Ill."
- And that's the year

167
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,169
I got felt up for the first time

168
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:47,204
- under the shirt.
- Always a big moment

169
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:48,572
in a young boy's life.
All right, tell us

170
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:49,740
about the case.

171
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,008
We were working organized crime,

172
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:53,010
and we took down
a mafia boss, Gio Costa,

173
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:54,578
for running cocaine.

174
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:56,013
We were the studs of the Nine-Nine.

175
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:58,015
Well I'm sure "studs" is a bit of a...

176
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,083
Oh, my God. I can't believe

177
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:00,250
I'ma say this, but...

178
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,119
Meow.

179
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:04,188
No, that is not what I was gonna say,

180
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,023
but honestly, yeah, meow.

181
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,192
No offense, guys, but what
the hell happened to you?

182
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:09,593
Are you body shaming us?

183
00:06:09,617 --> 00:06:11,195
No, I'm personality-shaming you.

184
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,564
You were so alert and cool
and job-doing.

185
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:15,032
So how did you get to Costa?

186
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:16,266
We had a CI on the inside

187
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,267
who helped set up a sting.

188
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,769
We took down Costa,

189
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,104
recovered a ton of coke

190
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:21,805
and three duffel bags full of cash.

191
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,107
Seems pretty clear-cut,

192
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:24,708
but then why would IA reopen the case?

193
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,243
Unless... they think it's some sort

194
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,212
of "Freaky Friday" situation
and you guys traded places

195
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,880
with horny singles in your area.

196
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,715
- It's possible.
- So what happened to the CI?

197
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,283
Who knows? It was so long ago.

198
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:35,586
I mean, I barely remember
how I got to work this morning.

199
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,920
I think there was
an ambulance involved.

200
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:38,155
- Oh, there was.
- Oh.

201
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,656
Wait a minute. Here's a question.

202
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,924
You said you recovered

203
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:42,133
three duffel bags full of cash

204
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:43,761
and that's what
the evidence logs say as well.

205
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:44,762
- Yeah.
- So?

206
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:46,630
So count the bags.

207
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:48,332
One, two, three, like you said,

208
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:50,134
but then take a look
in this mirror behind you,

209
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:52,236
the one that shows off
your shockingly taut bottoms.

210
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,904
A fourth bag.

211
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,139
Oh, probably missed it.

212
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:56,907
Yeah, you know us. We're dumb-dumbs.

213
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,243
But even you wouldn't miss
a giant bag full of cash.

214
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,111
- It was the '80s.
- Police weren't perfect then

215
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:02,980
- like they are today.
- All right, calm down.

216
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,648
We're not accusing you
of anything, right, Jake?

217
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:06,250
- Kinda was.
- This is crazy!

218
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,085
- We're innocent!
- IA is railroading us

219
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:10,687
like Holt said, and you're
joining in the witch hunt!

220
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:12,089
You're fake news!

221
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:13,590
Sad!

222
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:18,318
Yeah, that's definitely
the language of the innocent.

223
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,020
Okay, so there are
two questions on the table.

224
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:23,221
First, who was more bang-able,

225
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:24,556
young Hitchcock or young Scully?

226
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,024
Young Hitchcock. Total smoke show.

227
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:27,392
Agreed, but it's close, and second,

228
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,093
did they steal a big old bag
full of mob cash?

229
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:31,371
They said they didn't do

230
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,739
anything wrong. I believe them.

231
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:33,740
When I brought up the fourth bag,

232
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:34,875
they stormed out.

233
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,376
Or, once again, I think

234
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,978
you just can't help being suspicious

235
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,479
- of everyone.
- Oh, my God.

236
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:41,048
Is that what this is about?
You're mad because I said

237
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:42,416
the old sea captain you want to adopt

238
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,454
is scamming you?

239
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,209
Dragomir is not a captain.
He clubs the fish

240
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,088
in the bottom of the boat.
That's his after-school job.

241
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:48,882
Okay, Charles, you are
letting your emotions

242
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:50,264
cloud your judgment with Dragomir

243
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,575
and with these guys.

244
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,073
I mean, for all we know,
Hitchcock and Scully

245
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,145
have been playing us for years

246
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:55,279
like criminal masterminds.

247
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:58,616
Okay, so maybe not masterminds,

248
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,618
but I'm still going in there
and getting the truth.

249
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:02,153
All right, guys, let's not make this

250
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,487
any more difficult than it has to be.

251
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:04,989
We know there was
a fourth bag of money.

252
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,490
- Where'd it go?
- We told you dorks.

253
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:08,592
We never saw it. Now leave us alone.

254
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:10,161
I don't think you get
what's happening here.

255
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,328
This is an interrogation,

256
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:12,997
and it's only gonna end one way:

257
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:14,498
with you telling us everything.

258
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,333
Something funny?

259
00:08:16,357 --> 00:08:18,369
It's just I don't think
you get what's happening here.

260
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,504
You're locked
in a small, windowless room

261
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,173
with the two of us
one hour after lunch.

262
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,174
- Oh no.
- You want to know

263
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:24,308
what we ate?

264
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:25,609
Four-cheese pizza, double-cheese,

265
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:28,012
with a side
of cheesy fries, extra cheese,

266
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:29,380
and a big old slice of cheesecake.

267
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:31,515
But, Scully,

268
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,317
- you're lactose intolerant.
- Yeah.

269
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:37,521
This whole room
is a [BLEEP] Dutch oven.

270
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:39,190
What the hell is this?

271
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,624
The downstairs people

272
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:42,626
keep making a mess of the microwave.

273
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,195
One of them thought it was cool

274
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,397
to heat up soup in an uncovered dish.

275
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:48,332
- That's just crazy!
- How do you know

276
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:49,533
that's our splatter? There are some

277
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:51,235
sloppy Susans upstairs.

278
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:53,003
I saw it go down. It was one of you,

279
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:54,505
- so ya banned.
- No way.

280
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:56,974
This microwave belongs
to the entire precinct,

281
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:59,009
so I'm nah-banned.

282
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,178
Actually, turns out, this microwave

283
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,546
is not precinct property.

284
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,381
Detective O'Shea brought it from home

285
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,484
- back in '98, so...
- Ya banned.

286
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:08,219
I went to visit O'Shea's widow.

287
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:09,353
- He's dead?
- Big-time.

288
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,588
She is not over it.

289
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:13,157
Anyway, I got her to sign a contract

290
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,426
that states the upstairs has exclusive

291
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,027
microwave rights.

292
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,529
You bothered a widow with this?

293
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:20,331
Honestly, it wasn't
that awkward for me.

294
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,499
Rosa did it.

295
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:23,100
It was rough, but she signed it,

296
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:24,568
so ya banned.

297
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:26,604
Okay, now that we can all breathe,

298
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:28,339
let's try this again,
unless you want to try

299
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:29,607
and stink up the entire city
of New York.

300
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,408
Challenge accepted.

301
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,010
Okay, everyone, be cool! Be cool!

302
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,211
Just tell me everything that happened

303
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,246
after the bust.

304
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,280
I'll tell you what happened.

305
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:37,715
We were frigging heroes.

306
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:39,583
Anybody have a trash can?

307
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,219
'Cause Flat Top and the Freak
are bringing in some garbage.

308
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,956
You guys had badass entrance lines

309
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,258
and people cheered?

310
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:49,126
What happened?
Where'd it all go wrong?

311
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,594
Some things aren't for us to know.

312
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:52,963
Look, guys, we never had that money.

313
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,465
Here. We'll prove it to you.

314
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:56,233
Those are our financial records.

315
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,435
I don't have any retirement.
I don't have any security,

316
00:09:58,459 --> 00:09:59,470
or a car.

317
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,105
I rent most of my clothes.

318
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,106
We get it. You're poor.

319
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,108
I'm not just poor, son.

320
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,476
I'm destitute.

321
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,244
Definitely not a wink-able line.

322
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:08,746
Ugh, look at all
these credit card charges

323
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,414
for Wing Slutz.

324
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:11,615
It can't be healthy
to eat there this much.

325
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,250
If you want a diet option,

326
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:15,119
the Marine Park location
has a blue cheese parfait.

327
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:17,121
You guys go all the way
down to Marine Park for wings?

328
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:18,389
There's a waitress there
who always gives us

329
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:19,623
an extra drumstick

330
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,292
- in our slut bucket.
- Wait a minute.

331
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:22,760
Why do you pay
for a monthly parking spot?

332
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,395
Because it's New York.
It's hard to park.

333
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:25,763
Yeah, but he just said
he doesn't have a car.

334
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:27,231
So what's parked in this spot

335
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:28,632
you don't want us to know about?

336
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:31,502
Could it be
a super-expensive sports car,

337
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:33,103
paid for in cash?

338
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:34,305
Nope.

339
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,106
It's just a sketchy old sex van.

340
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,509
There is nothing sketchy
about the Beaver Trap.

341
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:40,578
Yes, there is.

342
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:42,146
In short, Commissioner Kelly's

343
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,447
new initiative

344
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:45,482
is a regressive, wrongheaded return

345
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:49,153
to the NYPD's darkest days.

346
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,154
How was that?

347
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:51,689
Like watching a corpse

348
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:54,425
wash up on shore, lifeless.

349
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:56,126
Come on, you gotta pace it up, okay?

350
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,328
You need to smile more.

351
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:59,663
Energize the eyes! Gesticulate!

352
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,498
You're describing
the behavior of a crazy person.

353
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:03,367
Am I? Because right now,

354
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,336
you can't take your eyes off me.

355
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,670
Oh, that must be

356
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:08,205
the camera crew,
here to set up the remote.

357
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:09,506
Oh, but you're not ready.

358
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,175
This is gonna be
like "The King's Speech,"

359
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,676
before he lost all that weight
or whatever.

360
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,378
- I haven't seen that movie.
- Oh, it's fine, Gina.

361
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,680
I don't need any tricks.
I've got the truth,

362
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,215
and the truth is all I need

363
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,617
to bring down...

364
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:21,452
Commissioner Kelly!

365
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:23,287
Hello.

366
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,222
So, Hitchcock, what's the
deal with the secret van?

367
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:26,657
Oh, nothing. It's where I sleep

368
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:27,691
during my divorces.

369
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:29,059
If this van's a-rocking,

370
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,494
my ex-wife's a-locking...

371
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:31,695
me, out of her house.

372
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,130
Catchy.

373
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:34,531
What are we doing here, Jake?

374
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,066
- What are we even looking for?
- Whatever it is

375
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,801
that Hitchcock's trying
to hide from us.

376
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:40,204
I'd imagine he'd be hiding
everything in here from us.

377
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:42,306
- It's a van of horrors.
- Yeah, I know.

378
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,575
I saw the bucket of male body butter,

379
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,543
and her. But my gut tells me

380
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,078
there's a smoking gun in here.

381
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:49,380
It's like you want them to be guilty.

382
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,547
I don't. I just want

383
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,749
to know what happened, unlike you,

384
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:52,755
who doesn't want them to be guilty,

385
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:53,808
no matter what the truth is.

386
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,568
I'm not an idiot
just because I have a heart.

387
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:56,939
Well, your heart
just might be an idiot,

388
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,256
because voilà!

389
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,591
So many smells. Shouldn't have gone

390
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:02,092
- for the flourish.
- Wait, is that...

391
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:03,560
The fourth bag from the picture.

392
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:07,398
Same logo, same stain
under the handle, and...

393
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,066
It's empty. They're guilty!

394
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,401
Nuh-uh. Not necessarily.

395
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,905
I mean, there could be a very good...

396
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:15,339
Damn it. We're trapped!

397
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:16,674
We're trapped in the Beaver Trap!

398
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:18,175
We're the beavers!

399
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,332
We're the beavers!

400
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:24,457
It won't budge.

401
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,569
I can't believe we let
Hitchcock and Scully

402
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:26,570
get the drop on us.

403
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:27,571
It's like being outsmarted

404
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:28,572
by a couple of tomatoes.

405
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:29,639
I'm the tomato.

406
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:30,907
I was wrong about them,

407
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,409
and I'm probably wrong about Dragomir.

408
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,410
I'm too nice.

409
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:34,978
I let every random jerk

410
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,913
suckle at the teat
of my human kindness.

411
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,048
Gross. Now please

412
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:39,649
hand me that mannequin's leg.

413
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,418
There were so many
warning signs about Dragomir.

414
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:42,719
Nikolaj had never heard of him...

415
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:43,920
- He's 45.
- He asked for money.

416
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,322
- He's 45.
- He didn't have

417
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:46,656
- a birth certificate.
- He's 45.

418
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,924
- He looked older than 15.
- He's 45.

419
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,493
Fine. He was 45.

420
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,628
I'm just a sucker,
trapped in a creepy sex van.

421
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:52,929
That's not entirely true.

422
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,754
You're no longer trapped in a van.

423
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,804
Oh, crap. They took our car.

424
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:02,072
All right, I'll just call them

425
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:03,607
and beg them to turn themselves in.

426
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,609
Oh, no. I left my phone in the car.

427
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,277
I know it's under one of their butts.

428
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:08,478
Ooh, if they have your phone,

429
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:09,846
we can track where they're going.

430
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,449
I have "Find My Phone"
set up to track you.

431
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:13,617
What? I do that for all my friends,

432
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:14,951
not just you.

433
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,086
Show me.

434
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,854
There's no time! Look,

435
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,689
they're headed south
on the Belt Parkway.

436
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:20,690
Ooh, check what exit they're taking.

437
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:22,025
Marine Park.

438
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:23,960
They're going to Wing Slutz!

439
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:25,529
But how do we get there?
We don't have a car.

440
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,186
But we do have a van.

441
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:31,001
Yeah, we should have taken a Lyft.

442
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,035
I feel like a predator.

443
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:33,503
This isn't our car!

444
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:34,671
- It's a loaner.
- We respect women!

445
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:35,872
I'm still with her!

446
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:37,874
So you are doing a TV interview?

447
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:39,876
- That's cool.
- Why are you smiling?

448
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,545
'Cause he's one
of those friendly villains,

449
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:43,613
like the Verizon guy
who defected to Sprint.

450
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:44,881
If you're angry, come out and say it.

451
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:46,716
I'm not angry. I'm just curious

452
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,018
about what all this means.

453
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,486
It's not often
that one of our captains

454
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,488
makes an unapproved media appearance.

455
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:53,056
- It's fun.
- I plan on using

456
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,025
this interview to criticize you
and your policies.

457
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:57,627
Okay. That's your prerogative.

458
00:13:57,651 --> 00:13:58,895
No, don't chuckle.

459
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,730
A frown is
a more appropriate response.

460
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,332
- I like you, Raymond.
- No, you don't.

461
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:03,867
I do! And I just came down here

462
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:06,002
to tell you that if you
go through with this interview,

463
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:07,838
I have some real fun ideas

464
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:10,340
about ways to spice up life
at the Nine-Nine.

465
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,008
I don't like your threats,
and I don't like

466
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:13,910
the cheery manner in which
you've chosen to deliver them.

467
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,846
Well, I'm just a cheery guy.

468
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,014
- You're a snake.
- Okay.

469
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:19,649
I'm a snake.

470
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:25,856
Oh, no, they found us!

471
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,490
Damn straight, we did.
What were you thinking?

472
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:29,693
They obviously
weren't thinking about anyone,

473
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:31,428
especially the one friend... me...

474
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:32,929
who had their backs
and believed in them

475
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,397
the whole time!

476
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:35,665
Why is the little one so mad?

477
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:36,833
He's going through something.

478
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:38,501
Now stand up, wet wipe your hands,

479
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:39,903
and put them behind your backs
so we can cuff you.

480
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:41,171
Oh, thank God.
I'm so tired of running.

481
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:42,873
- It's only been an hour.
- Stop.

482
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:44,441
They didn't do anything wrong.

483
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:45,742
Excuse me, ma'am.
This is police business.

484
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:47,510
I know. I'm Donna, the manager here,

485
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,045
but my real name's Marissa Costa.

486
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:50,780
I'm Gio Costa's wife,

487
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:52,115
and I'm the reason they're here.

488
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,050
- You were the informant.
- Yeah, I was.

489
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,852
Marissa's the only reason
we got Costa.

490
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,454
And our captain screwed her over.

491
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:58,889
He wouldn't put her
in Witness Protection.

492
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:00,390
So you did take the cash. You just

493
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:02,025
didn't keep it. You gave it to her.

494
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,727
We come down here
and check on her periodically.

495
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:05,195
Yeah, we never spoke,
but if she put an extra wing

496
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:06,730
in our slut bucket,
it meant everything was okay.

497
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:07,964
Wait, so I was right.

498
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:09,566
Hitchcock and Scully are good people.

499
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,901
You bet your nips we are, skid mark.

500
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:12,435
Well,

501
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:15,472
people are complicated.
These two contain...

502
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:16,907
- multitudes.
- Yeah.

503
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,041
Hey, guys.

504
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:19,809
I just wanted to say

505
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,077
that I talked to my squad,

506
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:22,112
and we're sorry

507
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:23,613
we've been so disrespectful

508
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:24,915
- of your space.
- Really?

509
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:26,216
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

510
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,751
We just want to make things right.

511
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,886
You upstairs people are really great,

512
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,755
and there's a lot
we can learn from you.

513
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,157
Well, that is true.
We are pretty great,

514
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,226
and you downstairs people
are gonna figure it out.

515
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,928
- You're all right.
- Thanks, Terry.

516
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,796
- Truce?
- Truce.

517
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,097
Now!

518
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,766
What the hell?

519
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,634
You thought the microwave
was a mess before?

520
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:46,903
Well, we just threw
a whole fish in there.

521
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,672
What happened to the truce?

522
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,640
- The truce was crap.
- You bet it was.

523
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:52,108
Viva the downstairs people!

524
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:55,946
What the hell was in that fish?

525
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,514
I don't know. It's from the Gowanus.

526
00:15:57,538 --> 00:16:00,183
It probably ate a bunch of batteries

527
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:02,786
Diaz, what is going on?

528
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,688
Commissioner Kelly
is still in my office.

529
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:06,122
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

530
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:07,791
We were just having
a minor disagreement.

531
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:09,125
Well, can it!

532
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,027
I am struggling for the very soul

533
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:12,529
of the NYPD,

534
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:14,130
so please stop squabbling

535
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:15,598
over these unimportant things.

536
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:16,800
Of course, sir,

537
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:17,801
but it's not unimportant.

538
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:19,769
The overcrowding, the desks...

539
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:20,971
it's affecting morale.

540
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,706
Jeez, something smells funky.

541
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,974
What happened here?

542
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:25,542
Uh-oh. Was it a fight,

543
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,043
because it's so crowded?

544
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,478
I hope nothing else happens

545
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:29,980
to make everything worse.

546
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,481
Listen, Kelly,
I'm going to do that interview,

547
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:33,016
and you can't stop me, so go ahead.

548
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,685
Cut our budget,
close more of the building,

549
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,288
open other fake IA investigations

550
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:40,156
- into my detectives.
- I didn't do that.

551
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,158
No, the IA thing... your detectives

552
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:43,226
aren't under investigation,

553
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,995
although it's not a bad idea.

554
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,664
Hey, thanks for the suggestion.

555
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:49,566
Excuse me.

556
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,634
I need to make a call.

557
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:53,003
Okay, thank you, sir. Hey, guys,

558
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:54,704
I have something
super important to tell you,

559
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:56,006
but first, Scully, you have
a Hitler sauce moustache.

560
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,240
Thank you. Go on.

561
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:58,541
Internal Affairs isn't actually

562
00:16:58,565 --> 00:16:59,576
investigating your case.

563
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,844
That call you got wasn't real.

564
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,746
What? The guy on the phone

565
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,847
sounded legit.
He had a very deep voice.

566
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:05,181
If it's not IA, who is it?

567
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,182
My guess is someone who wanted us

568
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:07,217
to lead them to Marissa.

569
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,644
Which, apparently, we just did.

570
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,144
That's Gio Costa.
How'd he get out of jail?

571
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:19,294
Probably for good behavior.
He had really great manners.

572
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:21,725
Yeah, he and his gigantic gun
look like real sweethearts.

573
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:22,909
- Noice.
- All right,

574
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,205
we gotta get out of here.
Is there a back exit?

575
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:25,173
- Through the kitchen.
- Great.

576
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:26,110
All right, listen up, everybody.

577
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,779
We're NYPD. If you could all please

578
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,291
head to the back exit immediately.

579
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,492
Leave the wings, Hitchcock.

580
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,860
No!

581
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,532
Look, Jake, it's the slut sauce!

582
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,100
- It's perfect!
- Hey, guys,

583
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,668
we gotta leave,
and we gotta leave right now.

584
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,370
- Charles, let's go.
- Negative.

585
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,871
I count three,
possibly four gunmen out there.

586
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,439
All right, no one panic.

587
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,808
I'm sure they didn't even
see us come in here.

588
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,509
We saw you go back there.

589
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,111
Okay, so I was wrong about that.

590
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,612
I'm gonna go around back
and cut them off.

591
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,516
Knock this door down, now.

592
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,784
All right, here's the way I see it.

593
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,119
We gotta break out the back entrance

594
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,453
and get these people to the van.

595
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,655
Okay, everyone, just follow my lead.

596
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,290
No, we got you into this mess.

597
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,724
We'll get you out of it.
Follow our lead.

598
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,193
There are armed men out there.

599
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,561
We don't even have
our bulletproof vests.

600
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,829
We can use the slut sauce.

601
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,564
That's insane. It's not even solid.

602
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,898
The bullets will go right through it.

603
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,733
If you don't think
the slut sauce is solid,

604
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,902
then you might want to talk
to my rock-hard arteries.

605
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,804
We're doing this, and that's final.

606
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,374
Scully, it's time to sauce up.

607
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,147
- Why'd you stop yelling?
- Look.

608
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,584
Oh, thank god.

609
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,252
My wife and my dad are here.

610
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,553
I mean, Captain Dad.

611
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,855
I mean, I know who my dad is.

612
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,389
It's you. Hi, Amy.

613
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,691
SWAT just cleared out the dining room.

614
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,426
- They got everyone.
- Copy that.

615
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,727
All right, Charles, you can
bring everyone out.

616
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,495
The Nine-Nine is here.

617
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,831
See, everyone, I told you
we had it all under control.

618
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,166
There was no need to panic.

619
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,534
You're dead, Marissa.

620
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,506
No!

621
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,911
Are you guys okay? Did you get hit?

622
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,713
No. It hit the tub,

623
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:58,847
but the bullet didn't make it through.

624
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,948
The slut sauce...

625
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,250
it saved you.

626
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,451
You bet your nips it did,

627
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,552
skid mark.

628
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,187
Oh, Hitchcock.

629
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,922
You suck, man.

630
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,224
So I spoke to Internal Affairs,

631
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,960
and since Hitchcock and Scully
did steal that money,

632
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,262
even though it was to help someone,

633
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,696
there have to be consequences.

634
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,398
Desk duty, desk duty, desk duty...

635
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,532
One year of desk duty.

636
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,567
Yeah!

637
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,702
Oh, I mean, oh, no.

638
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,537
Thanks for getting there
so fast today, sir.

639
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,872
Were you able
to still do your interview?

640
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,441
He did not. However, I did so.

641
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,910
The real question is

642
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,611
what are police?

643
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,446
I'm sorry. Who are you again?

644
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,615
They said they've never had
more viewer complaints.

645
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,950
Controversial and loving it.

646
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,587
- Oh.
- Squad, I want to apologize.

647
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,923
I have been acting
as though nothing mattered

648
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,457
except my pursuit of justice,

649
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,892
but seeing my people in danger today

650
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,961
made me realize
I was being short-sighted.

651
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,796
I do give a hoot.

652
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,564
I give a hoot about all of you.

653
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,732
Are we gonna keep saying
"hoots"? Is this forever?

654
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:51,934
- I pray not.
- I'm gonna keep

655
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,435
pushing back against John Kelly,

656
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,437
- but not at your expense.
- Thank you, sir,

657
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,772
and we're going to stop

658
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,407
bickering with the upstairs people.

659
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,475
No, Amy.
We're all upstairs people now.

660
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,678
Thanks, Terry.

661
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,091
Mmkay. I clearly missed

662
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:05,385
a whole thing there.

663
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:07,171
Hey, man. I just want to say

664
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:08,773
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

665
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:10,274
I was wrong
about Hitchcock and Scully.

666
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:12,677
No, you were right.
I am too trusting sometimes.

667
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,579
I did a little digging on Dragomir.

668
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:16,881
Turns out, he's not 15. He's...

669
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:18,182
- 103.
- 34.

670
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:19,717
But the orphanage confirmed

671
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:21,752
he is actually Nikolaj's half-brother.

672
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,221
Anyway, we're taking it slow.

673
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:24,755
In a few months,
he'll come out to visit.

674
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:26,624
Hey, thanks for having our back today.

675
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,192
These are from the old studs
of the Nine-Nine

676
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:30,127
- to the new studs.
- Aww.

677
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,796
- Nice.
- Nice.

678
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,097
Well, I think they drank out of these.

679
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:34,131
- They're half-empty.
- Definitely.

680
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:35,199
Hitchcock's contact lens

681
00:20:35,223 --> 00:20:36,634
is floating in mine,

682
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:38,035
which once again begs the question,

683
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:39,804
what happened to those guys?

684
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:42,273
I mean, when did it all fall apart?

685
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:43,941
Hey, Donna, just want to make sure

686
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:46,811
you're okay here working at...
Wing Slutz.

687
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:48,279
Yeah. It's a good job,

688
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:49,814
and I'm excited about my new life.

689
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:51,082
- Thanks.
- Our pleas.

690
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:52,583
Well, we're gonna go hit the gym

691
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,118
- for the second time today.
- Wait.

692
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:57,154
You need some protein
to fuel those hard bodies.

693
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:59,223
- It's on me.
- Ah, what the heck.

694
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:03,160
One wing can't hurt.

695
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:27,244
