1
00:00:00,746 --> 00:00:02,358
Peralta, looks like
an old friend of yours

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,989
- is back in town.
- Who?

3
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:06,236
That guy Neil that you bunked
with at sleepaway camp?

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,914
Oh, Neil from camp was the best.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,038
He could pick up a milk carton
with his butt cheeks.

6
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:11,106
He was so funny.

7
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,021
You know who else was funny? Bill Cosby.

8
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,272
Charles, will you relax?
You're gonna love Neil.

9
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:16,832
It's not Neil. Why would it be Neil?

10
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:18,984
- It's Doug Judy.
- Oh, right.

11
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:21,025
Someone we all know
in a police capacity.

12
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:22,117
That makes more sense.

13
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,467
Someone's using his
signature move to steal cars,

14
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,003
plugging in to the OBD port

15
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,775
and reprogramming
the immobilizer module.

16
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,465
That's Doug Judy's MO, but it's not him.

17
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,052
- He told me he went legit.
- That's what he told you

18
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:32,957
last time too, before
he screwed you over.

19
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:34,829
Yeah, but he returned
the diamonds to me eventually,

20
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:36,078
and it turned out that was the only way

21
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:37,618
to get Giggle Pig off the streets.

22
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:39,874
Wait, I may be confusing our adventures.
What year was the cruise?

23
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:41,810
Dude's a criminal. People don't change.

24
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:43,585
Ever heard of Bruce Banner,
the Incredible Hulk?

25
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:44,951
You might want to talk
to his shirts and pants

26
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:46,195
about people not changing.

27
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,823
Well, I want to ask Doug Judy
some questions.

28
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,104
- You have his number?
- I always make contact through his mom.

29
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:53,758
I'll put you in touch with her,
but remember,

30
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:56,226
she thinks I'm his assistant Mangy Carl,

31
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:57,978
and he's a famous architect
who's designing

32
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:00,146
LeBron James' new school
for black astronauts.

33
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,234
Hello, Mrs. Judy?

34
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,031
I'm looking for your son, the architect.

35
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:08,511
Yes, I'm from... black NASA.

36
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:09,512
Is that a thing?

37
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:11,906
Oh, my. I didn't know.

38
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,821
I understand. Good-bye.

39
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,158
So Doug Judy will not be coming in.

40
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:19,152
What? Why not?

41
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,828
Oh, I see.

42
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:22,308
He is dead.

43
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:40,714

44
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:45,547
Wow, I don't know how to deal
with all these emotions, Terry.

45
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,312
No one I've been close with
has ever died before.

46
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:50,335
No tragic accidents to friends.
All my grandparents are alive.

47
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,666
How did you deal when Hodor died?

48
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:54,122
Not well, Terry.
Why would you bring that up?

49
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:56,342
Carl? Mangy Carl?

50
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,651
Yes. That is me.

51
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:00,692
I'm Trudy Judy, Doug's sister.

52
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:02,043
This is our aunt Patrice.

53
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:03,623
I'm so glad you could make it.

54
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,210
Doug really loved you.

55
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:08,180
- Oh, he talked about me?
- Oh, all the time.

56
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:11,139
He was so afraid he'd fall
back into your old life.

57
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:14,273
Doug made Mangy Carl an assistant
at the architecture firm.

58
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:16,443
He rescued him
from a life on the streets.

59
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:19,422
Yeah, I was down on my luck,
not a penny to my name.

60
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,594
- You were selling your body for money.
- Did Doug tell you that?

61
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,977
He said all your teeth fell out,

62
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,500
and your mouth was just a rotten hole.

63
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,328
100% accurate.

64
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:28,648
Plus you were sick from
those back-alley butt implants.

65
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:30,743
- Had to have 'em.
- Carl thought a plumper rump

66
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,892
would help him get his [bleep]
every night.

67
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,583
Yeah, I remember having that thought.

68
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:36,908
But the doctor just put
a bunch of mulch up there,

69
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,865
- and it got all infected.
- Dark days.

70
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:41,996
I'm sorry. It's just so sweet.

71
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,651
- The mulch thing?
- No, how Doug saved him.

72
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:47,654
Doug was always taking people
under his wing.

73
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:50,004
Doug said you have a beautiful voice.

74
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,397
Oh, he did? Well, I...

75
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,447
♪ Suppose that's true ♪

76
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:55,229
Would you want to sing a song for us?

77
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,333
What a nice thought,

78
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:58,367
but you know what, I don't
have anything prepared.

79
00:02:58,403 --> 00:02:59,925
Okay, well, if you don't want to sing,

80
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:01,693
you could just tell us
the inspiring story

81
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:04,366
of how Doug saved you
from being a mulch-butt ho.

82
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,492
I would like to sing a song
in honor of my dear friend

83
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:08,631
Doug Judy.

84
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:11,063
Oh, nothing better after a long shift

85
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,287
than coming to Shaw's.

86
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:14,619
It's like Cheers, where
everybody knows your name.

87
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,141
A place where everybody
knows your name is hell.

88
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:18,380
- You're describing hell.
- Guys, guys, guys.

89
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:19,686
Are those...

90
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:21,122
Firefighters.

91
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:22,574
Hey, what's going on?

92
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,434
Why is the FDNY in our cop bar?

93
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,480
We needed a new place,
since our bar, O'Brien's, burned down.

94
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:29,214
- You couldn't put that out?
- They probably started it.

95
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,958
Most arsonists turn out
to be firefighters.

96
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,960
That's not true,
though it is very common,

97
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,396
and definitely what happened
in this case.

98
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,702
I'm surprised you guys
even want to come here

99
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,182
since you have to take the stairs.

100
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:39,053
I know how much you like
sliding on poles.

101
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:40,489
We don't like sliding on poles.

102
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,535
We do it to save lives. It's dangerous.

103
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,058
You can ask my best friend Steve.

104
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:46,202
Oh, no, wait, you can't, actually,

105
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:47,496
because he's dead.

106
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,410
Tripped through a pole hole,
broke his neck.

107
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:50,641
That's horrible.

108
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:52,414
Sorry, but this is
a firefighter bar now.

109
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,828
Although we might want to make
some changes to the decor.

110
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:56,737
I'm thinking some old-timey
pressure gauges,

111
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:58,123
maybe an autographed photo

112
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,639
of Denis Leary from "Rescue Me."

113
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:01,642
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?

114
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,208
Check it out.

115
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,992

Thank you so much.

126
00:04:35,022 --> 00:04:37,131
I mean, it's a funeral.
That's psychotic.

127
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,213
I'm so sorry.

128
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,435
Why are there firefighters here?

129
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,970
Did one of them turn out
to be an arsonist

130
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:43,635
- and burn down their own bar?
- Actually, yes.

131
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:45,077
So predictable. But why did you call me?

132
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:46,207
There's nothing I can do about this.

133
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,122
You have gravitas.
Everyone listens to you.

134
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,992
Look, even if I could save Shaw's,
I'm not sure I'd want to.

135
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:52,648
This place is a hovel.

136
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,173
The only wine they serve
is from the Delaware Water Gap.

137
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:56,905
It's called "Charbonnay."

138
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:59,017
But this is our bar,
and it has been forever.

139
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,185
Change is a good thing.

140
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,396
Just yesterday, you were ranting

141
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,311
about the Philharmonic
adding a second piccolo.

142
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:04,900
It's too many. It'll muddle the sound.

143
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:05,981
I'm sorry I brought it up.

144
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:07,663
Look, we can find a new bar

145
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,287
that's not beneath us.

146
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:10,536
What about Bel Vino?

147
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,501
They've got a great
selection of Italian reds,

148
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,010
and your feet don't stick to the floor

149
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:15,323
if you stand in one place too long.

150
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,499
Fine. If you're not gonna
do anything, then I will.

151
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,529
Hank, you got to get rid
of these hose humpers.

152
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,830
- It's them or us.
- Look, guys, I don't want to take sides.

153
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,027
I just want to make money.

154
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,186
Then keep it a cop bar.
We drink like crazy.

155
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:27,161
Yeah, 'cause of all
the tragedy we experience

156
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:29,076
on a daily basis, son.

157
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,210
Oh, yeah? We experience
plenty of tragedy too.

158
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:33,932
We lose a man a year to the pole hole.

159
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:35,387
How about this?

160
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,346
If it's about money,
let's just have a drink-off.

161
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,609
Whoever racks up
the biggest tab by closing time

162
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:42,089
gets to keep Shaw's.

163
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,350
Okay, defectives.

164
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,617
- My guys can handle that.
- Oh, can they?

165
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:51,055
'Cause the Nine-Nine's
about to bring the real heat.

166
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:54,796
Get ready for the back draft, bitch.

167
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,036
Jake, are you upset?
Where are you going?

168
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:58,543
Are you embarrassed about your singing?

169
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,059
- Doug Judy.
- What?

170
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:03,502
Hey, Jake. Man, that song was moving AF.

171
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,243
We got to lay that down.

172
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:07,854
♪ Doug Judy, he's
smushing on the beach ♪

173
00:06:07,897 --> 00:06:09,766
Don't try and duet with me, you bastard.

174
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,399
You tricked me. Now give me a hug.

175
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:12,923
I'm so happy you're alive.
I'll never forgive you.

176
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,165
You're my best friend.

177
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,470
Whoo, I just went through
a lot of emotions real fast,

178
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:17,211
but I think I'm back to normal now.

179
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,083
- Should we get lunch?
- I would love a cheesesteak.

180
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,649
I was thinking the exact same
thing, probably 'cause...

181
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:22,434
The coffin looks like a hoagie roll.

182
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:24,218
Judy, what the hell is going on?

183
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:26,075
Uh, who are you, and where is Rosa?

184
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,851
I'm his boss, and I want answers.

185
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,618
All right. You know
who Stefano Lucas is?

186
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:30,746
The arms dealer?

187
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,936
I got word he put a hit out
on me, so I had to disappear.

188
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:34,811
Why does Stefano Lucas want you dead?

189
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,187
His favorite Ferrari got stolen,

190
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,753
and for some reason he thinks I did it.

191
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,233
Probably because
someone's been jacking cars

192
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:40,669
all over Brooklyn using your MO.

193
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,149
Oh, my God. Jake, are you saying

194
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,729
- what I think you're saying?
- Yes.

195
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:45,631
You have a copycat.

196
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,678
I didn't think I'd accomplished
enough in my career for this.

197
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:48,764
I know, it's big.

198
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,723
It just feels so good
to be seen, you know?

199
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:52,725
Wait. The only way to catch a copycat

200
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:55,058
is to team up with
the original criminal.

201
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:56,973
I'm back on the force! Give me a gun.

202
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,253
No! There is no copycat. You did it.

203
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:01,168
Not me. I'm living that straight life.

204
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,388
Terry refuses to believe it.
He thinks people can't change.

205
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:05,099
Tell that to Bruce Banner's
pants and shirt.

206
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,217
That's what I said.

207
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,479
Doug Judy, you're under arrest.

208
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:09,255
What? Sarge?

209
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:13,262
You are really bringing down
the vibe at this funeral.

210
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,577
What the hell is that?

211
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,018
Jake got me this disguise

212
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:19,497
so some criminal doesn't see me
in here and tell Stefano.

213
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,435
Okay, but why is Jake also wearing them?

214
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,894
Uh, because it looks super cool, Sarge.

215
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:25,939
We look like the hot twins
from "The Matrix."

216
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:29,502
We are getting aggravated.

217
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,249
- You look like Milli Vanilli.
- Ooh! I call Vanilli.

218
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:33,077
Ah, I want to be Nilli, but you got it.

219
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,629
- He's the best one.
- You know it's true.

220
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:36,380
So did you check out Judy's alibi?

221
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,822
Yes, and surprisingly, it checks out.

222
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:41,151
Last Saturday night, Doug was deejaying

223
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:42,738
Joshy Greenbaum's bar mitzvah.

224
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,203
That was a wild party.

225
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,984
Auntie Karen is a freak.

226
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,441
Judy, you deejay bar mitzvahs?

227
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,093
Best gig I ever had.
No one likes hip-hop more

228
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,563
than a 13-year-old Jewish boy.

229
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,923
- Mm. So true.
- I'm not buying it.

230
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,808
Probably stealing cash
off the gift table.

231
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:56,728
Sarge, come on. He has an alibi.

232
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,219
Let's just team up and
try and catch the copycat.

233
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:00,508
A thousand push-ups.

234
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:01,886
It's something Rosa and I used to say.

235
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:03,606
It just means trust me.
If Judy's a criminal,

236
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:05,765
I'll do a thousand push-ups,
and since you're so confident,

237
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:07,154
if you're wrong, you can do 'em.

238
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:08,939
And a thousand push-ups?
That's a lot to you?

239
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:10,510
You go to hell, Terry.

240
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:12,177
Make it 100,000 push-ups, and I'm in.

241
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:13,813
Obviously I can't do that much exercise,

242
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:15,902
but it doesn't matter, because
Doug Judy is telling the truth,

243
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,077
- right, Judy?
- I got you, baby.

244
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,862
So fine. 100,000 push-ups.

245
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,092
You happy, Sarge?

246
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:22,862
- Great. Now, Doug...
- You never call me Doug.

247
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:23,986
Yeah, well, you called me Jake earlier.

248
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:25,226
I thought we were switching
to first names.

249
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,539
I was thinking the same exact thing!

250
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:27,914
I was like, "Why not call him Jake?"

251
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,133
- We're bonding, man.
- 'Cause he's so official.

252
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,093
But it's chill now.

253
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,226
- So, Doug...
- Yes, Jake?

254
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,533
Now that we know the copycat
is using your playbook,

255
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,883
if you were still in the game...
which you're not,

256
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:42,320
we all agree...
what would your next move be?

257
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:44,235
It's fight night at Barclays.

258
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,150
No sport attracts more
ultra-wealthy people

259
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,847
with super-nice cars than boxing.

260
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:50,727
Really? What about the sport
of hunting man?

261
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,156
- You got me.
- That's not a thing.

262
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,657
Right. So should we just
start at Barclays then?

263
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:56,508
Great. But first, we got to make
a quick little pit stop on the way.

264
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:57,814
What? Where?

265
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,166
Okay, here are the rules to the contest.

266
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:08,346
If you order a drink,

267
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,580
it must be fully consumed
before you order another.

268
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,003
Each team's tab will be
tracked on that board.

269
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:15,222
We don't want anyone
getting alcohol poisoning,

270
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,184
so if you throw up, you're disqualified.

271
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,401
I never throw up. I just tell
my stomach to deal with it.

272
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:21,098
My body is terrified of me.

273
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:22,447
Guys, there's no way we can win.

274
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,319
There's nine of them and six of us.

275
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:26,364
Five of you. I'm going home.

276
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,235
Although perhaps I'll stop
at Bel Vino on the way,

277
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,716
have a glass of Sancerre.

278
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,108
Might even try the quince paste

279
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:34,004
if I'm feeling... naughty.

280
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,373
You're really gonna let
these firefighters

281
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,027
take Shaw's from us?

282
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,203
Think of all the celebrations
we've had here,

283
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,581
all the times Terry has yelled
"Nine-Nine!"

284
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,618
I hate it when he says that.

285
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:44,251
He should say, "Cheers

286
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:45,427
to the Ninety-Ninth Precinct!"

287
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,212
We shouldn't be here.

288
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,648
If you're worried that
someone will recognize me

289
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,544
and find out I'm still alive,
they won't.

290
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,043
There's not too many hardened criminals

291
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:55,045
at Justin Friedman's bar mitzvah.

292
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:58,429
Although there is a
murderer on the loose,

293
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,589
'cause Kevin Goldman is
killing those dance moves!

294
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,756
Get it, Kevin!

295
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,621
That's the floss. He's flossing.

296
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:05,533
It's just that we should
be at Barclays already.

297
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,745
The fights are starting soon.

298
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,450
Rich guys never show up on time.

299
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:10,626
Besides, I promised Justin I'd be here.

300
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:11,975
What up, J-Smooth!

301
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,516
Gone straight, my ass.
I got you, Doug Judy.

302
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,598
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

303
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,611
Something felt wrong,
stopping for this bar mitzvah,

304
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,316
so I sent some plainclothes officers

305
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:23,944
to watch the lots at Barclays.

306
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,792
- They just caught the copycat.
- I don't understand.

307
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:27,382
If anything,
that proves Judy's innocent.

308
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:28,828
He's been standing here with us
the whole time.

309
00:10:28,864 --> 00:10:31,386
Which was his plan! Establish an alibi,

310
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,242
so his partner can go off stealing cars.

311
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:34,410
I don't have a partner.

312
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,608
Whoever this is, I promise you,
I do not know him.

313
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:39,045
Actually, Doug, I think you do.

314
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,438
Oh, my God.

315
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:41,961
Trudy Judy!

316
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:44,478
You still want to pretend you
had nothing to do with this?

317
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:46,437
I didn't, and she didn't either.

318
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,622
Trudy Judy's not a car thief.

319
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:49,007
Trudy Judy's an angel.

320
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:50,558
She's putting herself
through nursing school.

321
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:52,253
And nurses are the best of our society.

322
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,400
Name one bad nurse.

323
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,658
Nurse Ratched. Kathy Bates in "Misery."

324
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:57,068
Nurse Jackie had a pill problem.

325
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:58,753
Okay, damn, you got a lot
of real good examples

326
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:00,581
off the top of your head.
You believe me, right, Jake?

327
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,235
I mean, the fact pattern's not great,

328
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,989
but Trudy did seem very nice
when I met her.

329
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:05,454
You trying to get your
freak on with my sister?

330
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,326
What? No.

331
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,762
I see you looking at Trudy Judy's booty.

332
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,242
I am not looking at Trudy Judy's booty.

333
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:10,417
Oh, you don't think she's a cutie?

334
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,974
- Don't be snooty.
- She's a beauty,

335
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,464
- but I'm on duty.
- And you're married.

336
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,726
Well, yeah, but that doesn't rhyme.

337
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,116
Sorry, I just get so overprotective.

338
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:17,387
She's such a good kid.

339
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,122
I guarantee you,
she didn't steal those cars.

340
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:21,298
We caught her sitting in a
Bentley with a power amplifier

341
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,604
and a homemade override
plugged into the CAN bus.

342
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:24,821
Yeah, she guilty.

343
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,790
I can't believe you made
us think you were dead.

344
00:11:27,826 --> 00:11:29,177
I can't believe you're
out here stealing cars.

345
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,611
- That's for lowlifes.
- You steal cars.

346
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:32,700
And I'm a lowlife. A gorgeous, charming,

347
00:11:32,744 --> 00:11:34,284
super smart lowlife beloved by all.

348
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,452
I'm sorry, Dougie.

349
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:36,719
I was falling behind
on my student loans.

350
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,009
I had to do something.

351
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,646
Guys, if you weren't working together,

352
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,075
how did she know
all your signature moves?

353
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:42,706
I found some of Doug's old notebooks.

354
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:43,891
Those are notes for my memoir.

355
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,359
Memoir? Do you have title ideas yet?

356
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:48,153
I was just gonna call it
"The Pontiac Bandit..."

357
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,450
- Oh, is that it?
- Yeah.

358
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:53,022
- Okay.
- I hated stealing cars.

359
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:55,567
I was gonna stop as soon as nursing
school was paid off, I swear.

360
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:56,836
It was a mistake.

361
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:58,462
That's good enough for me.
Come on, Trudy, let's go home.

362
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:00,614
That's not really how arresting works.

363
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,377
- She's going to jail.
- Wait, wait, wait.

364
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:03,518
What if we get you a bigger fish?

365
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,104
- What if we can get you Stefano?
- Who?

366
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,475
That cherry red 1961 Ferrari
250GT California you took

367
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,390
belongs to a guy named Stefano Lucas.

368
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:12,305
He thinks I did it, and
now he wants to kill me.

369
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,698
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

370
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:15,265
It's all good. You have the car,

371
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,483
so I call him, tell him I'm not dead,

372
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,129
say I want to give him his car back,

373
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:21,227
arrange a drop, and these guys
take him down or die trying.

374
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:22,922
That is interesting.

375
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,491
Stefano almost never
comes out in public.

376
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,406
It would be a huge collar
for the Nine-Nine.

377
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,752
What do you say, Sarge?
100,000 push-ups?

378
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:32,369
Fine. If you deliver Stefano,
I'll talk to the DA

379
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:33,979
about a reduced sentence
for your sister.

380
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,677
Thank you so much.
There's just one problem.

381
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,204
I don't have the car.

382
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,724
I already handed it off to a fence.

383
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:42,205
Oh, Judy, Judy, you screwed me.

384
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:43,177
_

385
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,211
Four hours left. We're down $58.

386
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,118
- Amy, where you at?
- Four drinks.

387
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:48,863
- What's four-drink Amy again?
- Why don't you come over here

388
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,257
- and find out?
- Right, Horny Amy.

389
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:53,186
It feels like you should retire
that one for the MeToo era.

390
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,218
Why don't you come
over here and make me?

391
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,418
All right, there's only
one thing left to do.

392
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:57,568
Drink faster.

393
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,656
Set a bunch of fires
throughout the city.

394
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,319
- Mine's better.
- No!

395
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,091
We can do this.

396
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:04,183
Things seem bleak now,

397
00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:06,925
but the night is always darkest
before the dawn.

398
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:09,137
This is Shaw's.

399
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,398
We've had weddings here,

400
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,062
and funerals.

401
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,770
Shaw's is part of our family,

402
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,004
because that is what we are.

403
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,281
A family.

404
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:22,984
And we're not just Amy and Rosa

405
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:24,551
and Hitchcock and...

406
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:35,214
So the fence, Dallas, he works in there.

407
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:36,607
I don't like him. My rule?

408
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,445
Never trust anyone named after a city.

409
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,567
- What about Orlando Bloom?
- I never thought about him being named

410
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,656
after the city before,
and his last name is Bloom?

411
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,702
Wait a minute. Did we just
realize something crazy?

412
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:47,005
No, everyone knows it's a crazy name.

413
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,390
Now can we just focus on the meet-up?

414
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:49,924
- Fine.
- All right, Dallas is creepy

415
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,492
and paranoid, and he really
freaked me out that last time.

416
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:54,364
- I don't want to go in alone.
- Don't worry, kid.

417
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:56,255
I'll be there right
next to you, as always.

418
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,368
Aw. Sarge, why don't you
say stuff like that to me?

419
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,458
No, look, I do not trust the
Judys going anywhere alone.

420
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,242
Doug, you stay with Jake.
I'll go in with Trudy.

421
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:04,591
I just need a cover story.

422
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,977
We could say that you're my boyfriend.

423
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,246
No. No, no, no, I don't want

424
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,055
my little sister
fake-dating some pervert.

425
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,552
What? Why am I a pervert?

426
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,033
Uh, have you ever met a nice, normal guy

427
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:13,818
that wears suspenders every day?

428
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,296
What kind of person
has to tie their pants down

429
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,603
to keep them from flying off?

430
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,361
That's not what suspenders are for, man.

431
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,606
Guys, we don't have time

432
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,696
to figure out what suspenders
are for, all right?

433
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,306
Now, Trudy, this is undercover work.

434
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,090
It can be very intense.
Are you sure you can handle it?

435
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,614
I mean, I'll do my best.

436
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,992
- Who's this?
- This is Deion. He's my man.

437
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:32,838
Ask me another question,
you simple little barn animal.

438
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:34,527
Okay, so she can handle it.

439
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:35,622
Why is your boyfriend here?

440
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,040
Who said boyfriend? Deion and I freak,

441
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,441
then he shuts his pretty little mouth

442
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:40,845
and lets me handle my business.

443
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,496
I don't like the direction
this is going.

444
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:43,804
Easy. She's just playing a part.

445
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:45,284
Pretty big age difference here.

446
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:46,981
- Where'd you guys meet?
- The club.

447
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,548
Deion was a bouncer,

448
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:51,421
and I told him I wanted
him to bounce on me.

449
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:52,770
Oh, what is that?

450
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:54,075
Is she rubbing on his mic?

451
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,816
The mic that was taped to his chest?

452
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,296
You should feel these.

453
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,993
They're like two baseball bases.

454
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,517
Make 'em pop, daddy.

455
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,953
Daddy's not sure this is the time.

456
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:03,081
Do it, daddy!

457
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,422
Ooh, ow! Ooh, ow!

458
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,328
Get your hands off her, pervert!

459
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,000
Judy! Judy! I tried to stop him.

460
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:10,396
That's my baby sister you're caressing.

461
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,147
What? How can I caress her with my pecs?

462
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:14,615
Look at those things. They got thumbs.

463
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:16,708
Guys, guys, stop! Where is Dallas?

464
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:18,372
I think he got spooked and ran away.

465
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:19,666
Good job, Doug Judy.

466
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,842
You just cost your sister
a chance at a reduced sentence.

467
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,889
Oh, no! Why is my tone so playful?

468
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,673
Why is there a twinkle in my eye?

469
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:33,027
Because I just found our
1961 Ferrari 250GT California.

470
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:34,464
Oh, ho, ho!

471
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:36,553
Ladies and gents and pervert Terry,

472
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,163
we are in business.

473
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:40,513
Sorry, Sarge, I got caught up
in the moment there.

474
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,385
- _
- Guys, I threw up.

475
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:43,864
Oh, man, it's over.

476
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,518
- We need a miracle.
- I'm here.

477
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:47,162
Captain Holt! How are you here?

478
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,695
You called me.
You didn't stop calling me.

479
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,784
I didn't call you. Look.

480
00:15:50,828 --> 00:15:52,612
You left 17 voicemails.

481
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:53,874
Here's one.

482
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:56,351
<i>Holt! You got to come save us.</i>

483
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:57,704
<i>We need a lie to get you here.</i>

484
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,879
<i>Charles, what should I say?</i>

485
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:00,446
<i>That I got shot in the face.</i>

486
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,379
<i>Ooh, and tell him to bring pizza.</i>

487
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:04,025
Whoo! Crampon Holt!

488
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,236
We're losing.

489
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:07,018
- Yeah!
- Why are you dancing?

490
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:08,846
Oh, I was up to nine-drink Amy,

491
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,674
who speaks French,

492
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,249
and then I hurl...

493
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,852
I hurl... hurled.

494
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,723
What she's trying to say
is that she vomited,

495
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,551
and now she's back down
to three-drink Amy,

496
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:19,683
or Amy Dance Pants.

497
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:20,793
You know it.

498
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,816
My God.

499
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,818
Hitchcock, are you the only
person still making sense?

500
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:26,559
Yeah. It's bad.

501
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:29,234
So are you gonna make us
give up, Clappin?

502
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:30,737
Or are you here to tell us to stop?

503
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,391
No, I'm here to help you win.

504
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:34,394
What is happening? Why is this?

505
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,873
It's something you said
on one of your voicemails,

506
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,657
after you had sung
the entirety of a song

507
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:39,600
called "Shake Whatcha Mama Gave Ya."

508
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:41,289
You thought you had hung up,
but you hadn't.

509
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:44,882
<i>Anyway, bye-bye.
What am I doing calling him?</i>

510
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:47,537
<i>He doesn't care about us
or what we want.</i>

511
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,408
When I heard that,
I was shaken to my core.

512
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,319
I thought this bar was beneath me,

513
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,760
but what was actually beneath
me was my own behavior.

514
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,762
- I had turned my back on...
- Holt!

515
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,460
We do not have time for this.

516
00:16:57,503 --> 00:16:58,939
Just drinky, drinky!

517
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:03,422
Hank, bring me a Charbonnay.

518
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,504
All right, Stefano should
be here any minute.

519
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:07,992
I just want to thank you guys
so much for helping me.

520
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,515
I don't deserve your kindness.

521
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,951
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.

522
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:12,823
We all make bad decisions
when we're younger.

523
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,825
- I was once in a flash mob.
- Ew.

524
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,286
Something's off about this.

525
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:17,741
I don't like leaving Judy
out there alone.

526
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:19,271
Relax, we have a tracker on the car,

527
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:20,613
a tracker on Doug Judy,

528
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:22,746
and ESU has the entire area surrounded.

529
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,617
- It's gonna be fine.
- We got movement.

530
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:26,619
Okay, everyone, to your positions.

531
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:27,881
On my signal.

532
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:30,308
Hold. Hold.

533
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,233
Hold.

534
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,082
Sorry, I started holding too soon.

535
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:35,976
Let's start over. Hold.

536
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,674
Hold.

537
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,197
And...

538
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,658
Everyone, stop holding! Go, go, go, go!

539
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:46,151
Where is he? Where is he?

540
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,120
Got him. They got Stefano.

541
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:50,252
No, not Stefano. The Pontiac Bandit.

542
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:52,080
- Where is...
- Doug Judy here.

543
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,578
Y'all see that car blow up?

544
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,456
Yeah, we did. Why did you do that?

545
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,690
You think I did that?

546
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,086
Doug Judy does not work with fire.

547
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,740
Yeah, he's like the Hound
from "Game of Thrones."

548
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:02,102
I am like the Hound. And you're my Arya.

549
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:03,309
- Right?
- Guys!

550
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:05,790
If Doug Judy didn't blow up
the car, who did?

551
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,663
Trudy Judy.

552
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:11,431
_

553
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:16,627
Damn, sir, you took
that Charbonnay to the house.

554
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,455
- How you feeling?
- Let me take stock.

555
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,282
My equilibrium is askew,

556
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,459
my vision is partially impaired,

557
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,286
and I'm clearly slurring my words.

558
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,375
To put a fine point on it,
your boy is turnt.

559
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,799
Well, well, well,
there's only a minute left,

560
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:30,467
and you are six bucks down.

561
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,729
I don't think you guys
are gonna make it.

562
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:33,132
Hank, another Charb.

563
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,472
This one's hot.
It was sitting on the radiator.

564
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,740
- He's never gonna make it.
- Yes, he will.

565
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:45,612
Just don't breathe.
Let the liquid into your lungs.

566
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,792
Five, four, three, two...

567
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:53,315
Closing time! Cops win!

568
00:18:57,276 --> 00:19:00,714
All right, fine, the bar is yours.

569
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:04,352
But we're keeping this!

570
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:05,545
Come on.

571
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,591
Before we all go home and pass out,

572
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:10,550
I want to say how sorry I am
that I deserted you earlier.

573
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:13,597
I want you to know that I care
about you all so very much,

574
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,902
each and every one of you.

575
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,726
Boyle, Santiago, Diaz, Hitchcock, Scu...

576
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:22,475
All right, I have officers
looking for her.

577
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,259
She was on foot.
She couldn't have gone far.

578
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:26,392
This is her.

579
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,568
- Where are you, Trudy?
- In the wind, Dougie.

580
00:19:28,612 --> 00:19:30,527
Okay, that's a cool thing to
say, but what are you doing?

581
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,745
They were gonna reduce your charges.

582
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,442
Reduced charges are still charges,

583
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:34,835
and I can't go to prison.

584
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:37,882
There are no dudes there,
and I need to smush!

585
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,536
- Trudy!
- Oh, grow up, Doug.

586
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,538
I'm an adult woman
who's horny all the time.

587
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,801
- What is going on?
- Oh, are you judging me, ho?

588
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:45,367
Trudy, running from
the cops is a felony.

589
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:46,803
That means no more nursing school.

590
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,014
Good. It sucked.

591
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,245
I only went to, like, one class.

592
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:50,799
- What?
- It was boring as hell.

593
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:52,818
So then I started
running Internet scams.

594
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,072
Then there was identity theft.

595
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:55,464
I was Queen Latifah for a bit.

596
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,379
Then Lil' Kim. That was less believable.

597
00:19:57,423 --> 00:19:59,947
But then I found your old notebooks.

598
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,515
How come you never told me
how much fun car thieving is?

599
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,378
Because I didn't want you
to fall in love with it.

600
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:05,698
Wait, I'm confused.

601
00:20:05,734 --> 00:20:07,259
When did you put the
bomb in the Ferrari?

602
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:08,782
I didn't do it. Dallas did.

603
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:11,248
And Dallas isn't some
criminal I'm afraid of.

604
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,199
He's my employee. Say what's up, Dallas.

605
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:14,962
- Wassup?
- Named after a city.

606
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,573
The hard part was trying to figure out

607
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,267
how to tell him my plan,
so then I came up

608
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,532
with that whole boyfriend thing,

609
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:21,273
because I needed a distraction.

610
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:23,014
I knew you'd rush in,
all weird and old-fashioned,

611
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:24,581
try to protect my honor.

612
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,757
How can I caress her with my pecs?

613
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,585
Look at those things. They got thumbs.

614
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,238
I don't need you to protect me, Doug.

615
00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:31,457
You're my baby sister.

616
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,719
I got to look out for you.

617
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,026
That's so sweet, and also dumb.

618
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,091
I'll see you at Christmas, sucker!

619
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:38,638
I love you, big bro.

620
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:39,757
Trudy!

621
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,468
Man, I am gutted. This is awful.

622
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,383
Is this how you feel
every time I trick you?

623
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,102
Pretty much. Yeah, it always hurts.

624
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:47,340
Wow, I'm sorry, man.

625
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,777
It must be really hard
to hang out with me.

626
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,781
Well, it's a tough relationship,
but it's exciting.

627
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:52,633
Hey, Doug, I'm sorry
for not trusting you.

628
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,216
Turns out you had
nothing to do with this.

629
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,787
Oh, so you admit people can change.

630
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,528
Yes. Bruce Banner's pants
and shirt were correct.

631
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:01,008
You know what this means, right?

632
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,905
6,203.

633
00:21:02,941 --> 00:21:04,925
6,204.

634
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:06,753
I am so glad I lost this bet.

635
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:08,625
I never find time for things I enjoy.

636
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:09,886
This is so unsatisfying.

637
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:11,162
You're not even sweating.

638
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:12,766
It's too easy. Get on my back, Jake.

639
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:14,219
- No, I'm not...
- Get on my back, Jake!

640
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:15,778
Coming, strong man!

641
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:20,937
