1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,030
Hey, what's up?
I came as fast as I could.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,380
Title of your sex tape.
Nailed it.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,470
So have you ever heard of a guy
named Bruno Rojas?

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,990
Yeah, big guy
in the Colombian cartel, right?

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,910
He was, until he got shot
in the chest yesterday

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,390
by his top lieutenant.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,040
Apparently, the bullet went
straight through his nipple.

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,480
Whoa.
Nature's bull's-eye.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,870
Oh, my God, I love the way
your brain works.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,870
Anyway, he's in a coma now,
and Captain Holt thinks

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
if I'm here when he wakes up,
I can get him to talk.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,970
- So what'd you call me for?
- Because I need a partner.

13
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,230
- What about them?
- Oh, we're not here for work.

14
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,360
I brought Scully in because
he needs some medical tests.

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,930
Yeah, I'm here all the time.

16
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,580
I'm kind of the mayor
of this place.

17
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,840
Cheryl, baby,
you got a fresh bag for me?

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,460
Saving you the biggest one,
Scully.

19
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
You're too good to me.

20
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,240
Anyway, I'll see you guys
around.

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,680
Dan, Dan, the enema man.

22
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,815
Well, guess it's kind of nice
to see Scully in his element.

23
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:44,445
Whoo!

24
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:47,919
Jake, I can't stay here with you.
I have so much on my plate at work.

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,300
Yeah, so do I. I mean, I've been
pulling double shifts nonstop,

26
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,932
but we haven't really gotten
to hang out in almost a month.

27
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,579
Our anniversary is coming up, and
we don't even have anything planned.

28
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,445
I know,
but we talked about this.

29
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,415
We're gonna take a trip
as soon as we have time.

30
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,979
- I promise.
- Just like you promised

31
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,050
we would see
the "Bumblebee" movie?

32
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,144
I didn't promise that.
I believe what I said was,

33
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:06,259
"Isn't that a kids' movie?"

34
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,019
Yeah, and I believe
what I said was,

35
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,510
"It's for teens."

36
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,957
Look, I get that you can't
take any time off from work,

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,300
but this is a loophole.
It's still work.

38
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,365
You know, we can hang out here
and chat and catch up and laugh,

39
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:23,194
and technically, we'll be doing our jobs.
I call it a "casecation."

40
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,510
Ooh.

41
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:30,285
Babe, this is so sweet,

42
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:32,505
but do you honestly think
that Holt's gonna let me

43
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,297
just hang out here
with you indefinitely?

44
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:35,599
Yes. Just tell him
I need supervision.

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,485
I've spent the last six years
building up a reputation

46
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:39,373
as an irresponsible goof
for this very moment.

47
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,450
That is ridiculous.
Holt respects you.

48
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:42,244
Does he, though?

49
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:46,257
Hello, you've reached
the office of Raymond Holt.

50
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:47,717
I can come to the phone
right now.

51
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:49,793
Hey, sir, I'm just here
at the hospital with Jake,

52
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:50,994
and I think he could use some...

53
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,901
Oversight?
Agreed.

54
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:57,405
So?

55
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,555
Prepare to be romanced.

56
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:20,745
Voilà.

57
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:22,475
Bienvenue à Paris.

58
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:24,650
Bonjour, madame. Fromage?

59
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:25,991
Don't worry,
Charles is leaving in a second.

60
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:26,440
I am?

61
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:27,663
Yeah, you were just
helping me set up.

62
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:29,487
Fine. Enjoy your weird anniversary

63
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:31,725
- with just the couple.
- You selfish jerks.

64
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,100
Thank you for your help!

65
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,370
- So what do you think?
- I love it.

66
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,200
- It's really romantic.
- Aww.

67
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,590
I mean,
except for the comatose body

68
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:41,385
in the middle of the room.

69
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,110
Oh, yeah, just pretend
he's part of Paris.

70
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,290
Imagine we're on a walking tour

71
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,330
of the Louvre,
and he's a statue.

72
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,380
- Oh.
- Yeah. Shall we, ma chérie?

73
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,820
I asked the lady at the store
what her favorite cheeses were,

74
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,300
and those were all
super expensive,

75
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,860
so I got us a budget-conscious
selection of local cheddars.

76
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,820
So, a full year of marriage.
What was your favorite part?

77
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,040
Are you asking me
to do a marriage highlight reel

78
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,480
countdown
à la "NBA Inside Stuff"?

79
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,117
I mean, that's not exactly
what I was...

80
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,480
Number five!

81
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,394
Ahmad Rashad.
It's my best impression.

82
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,392
Number five was the time

83
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:10,890
that we accidentally got
our contact lenses switched.

84
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,060
I got to see the world
through your eyes.

85
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,405
But our prescriptions are different,

86
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,288
- and the world was so blurry.
- Yeah, it was crazy.

87
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,309
I thought I was having a stroke.

88
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,126
- Okay, your turn.
- Number four!

89
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:20,273
Oh, is an old witch
introducing this highlight?

90
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:21,810
That was exactly
what you sounded like.

91
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,433
- No.
- Yes.

92
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,435
- Agree to disagree.
- Fine.

93
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,765
Number four was
when we played laser tag

94
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,300
and we shot all those
little kids.

95
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,600
Oh, yeah. We really messed up
little Mason's birthday party.

96
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,610
- Mm-hmm.
- Deservedly so.

97
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,650
- He was a jerk.
- Ugh.

98
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,870
Okay, what should
number three be?

99
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,536
Ooh, I know.

100
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:36,270
It was that time we shared
an UberPool with Michael Caine.

101
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:36,899
Oh!

102
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:43,640
I mean, obviously, Michael Caine

103
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,660
was shooting a movie in London
at that time, and also,

104
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,240
why would Michael Caine be
in an UberPool?

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,958
- But it was still so cool.
- It really was.

106
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,635
- We shared a car with Alfred.
- We did!

107
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,562
Okay, number two.

108
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,221
This might be my favorite moment

109
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,820
of our entire time as a couple:
January 6th.

110
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,791
- Eddie Redmayne's birthday.
- Why do you know that?

111
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,001
'Cause he was weird
in "Jupiter Ascending."

112
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,531
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm just a fan.

113
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:02,548
Yeah, that's not what
I'm talking about.

114
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,061
Okay.

115
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,065
It was the coldest night
of the year,

116
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:09,675
and you put socks on my feet
while I slept.

117
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,635
You never even took credit
for it.

118
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:12,855
But now I'm getting credit
for that

119
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,545
and for not taking credit.

120
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:16,115
That's double credit, you fool.

121
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:18,065
You two are just the cutest.

122
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,035
I can't wait for number one!

123
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:21,775
Oh, it's Ahmad Rashad.

124
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:23,645
I'm Pam.
I'm from next door.

125
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:26,735
I was listening to the two of you
talk and just had to get a look.

126
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:30,215
You're both very attractive.

127
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:34,006
- Aren't they?
- Boyle, go home!

128
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:35,486
Oh, Pam can stay but not me?

129
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,796
Yeah, because
she's a patient here.

130
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:38,276
I'm assuming,
because of your gown.

131
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:39,706
I am.
I have a twisted bowel.

132
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:42,846
I have a tube; I have a bag.
Do you want to see?

133
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:44,496
Oh, no, no, no.
But thank you, Pam.

134
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:46,546
Let me know
if you smell anything.

135
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,246
I don't even notice it anymore.

136
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,486
Well, I'm pretty sure I actually
already smell something.

137
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:52,326
- No, you'll know.
- Oh.

138
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,654
Do you two have kids?

139
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:56,830
Mixed race babies are always
so adorable.

140
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,999
Oh, you said words.

141
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,789
Yeah, we don't have kids yet,

142
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:02,269
but we're gonna start trying
soon.

143
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:04,269
I just have the one, my Bobby.

144
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:07,929
He was such a cute little kid,
until he discovered his wiener.

145
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:11,449
Pam, there you are.
It's time for your IV.

146
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,849
You're playing music in here?
You can't do that.

147
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,279
Why not, Nurse Janet?

148
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,279
Is it gonna distract
the doctors?

149
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:19,289
Yes, that's exactly
what it'll do.

150
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,809
Okay, fine,
I'll turn it off immediately.

151
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,509
- Are we the bad guys here?
- Yeah, it seems very likely.

152
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:27,328
Hey, by the way, we don't have
to pretend we're undercover here.

153
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:28,539
The hospital staff knows
we're cops.

154
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,719
Oh, I wasn't setting up cover.

155
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,939
- Was I?
- Well, just the kids thing.

156
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,329
Saying that we were gonna
start trying soon.

157
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:34,639
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean right away.

158
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:36,989
I just meant in the near future.

159
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,989
Oh.
Okay.

160
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,249
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

161
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,599
Cool, cool, cool, cool,

162
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,989
except for that there's
one little problem there,

163
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,869
which is that I don't know
that I totally know

164
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,855
that I for sure
want to have kids,

165
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:49,569
so...

166
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,649
- You don't?
- No.

167
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,219
- Do you?
- Uhhuh.

168
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:56,619
Oh.

169
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:58,801
I don't understand.
I thought we were

170
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:00,170
on the same page about kids.

171
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,981
- We talked about this.
- We did?

172
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:04,981
Aw, look at these pictures
my brother sent of Matthew.

173
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,746
- Mm.
- We should do this someday.

174
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:07,747
What do you think?

175
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:08,967
Are you kidding me?
Of course.

176
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:10,627
I was talking about going
to the water park.

177
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,277
You were talking about
having kids?

178
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,887
Yeah! I said, "Do you think
we can afford it?"

179
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:17,457
And you said, "We'll start
saving right away."

180
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:18,677
So let me get this straight.

181
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,547
All that water park money
I've been saving,

182
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:21,937
you want to spend it
on kids now?

183
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:23,807
Yeah. Why would you want
to spend that much money

184
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:24,911
on a water park?

185
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:26,794
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say here.

186
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,979
I just...
I never wanted children.

187
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:30,329
Well, I always have.

188
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,679
All right,
so how do we handle this?

189
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,939
I mean, there's only one
thing to do when two people

190
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,954
have diametrically opposing
views on a subject.

191
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,875
Talk about it lovingly
and decide how to move forward?

192
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,634
- Structured debate.
- Oh. Fun.

193
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,595
High school format.
Modified Lincoln-Douglas.

194
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:45,425
Let's take one hour apart
for research and prep. Yeah.

195
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,735
Great, I'll just do
a Lincoln-Douglas.

196
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,605
I'd be careful if I were you.
Relationships are like bowels.

197
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:53,215
Once you get them twisted,
they can never untwist.

198
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,045
Pam, you're in here again.

199
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:04,160
That's all you prepped?

200
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:05,202
Yeah, I just searched my heart

201
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,952
and then wrote down
how I was feeling.

202
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:09,172
I'm gonna eat you alive,
you dumb son of a bitch.

203
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,472
Cool. And then
we'll have kids together?

204
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:12,782
Yeah. It's gonna be great.

205
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:14,082
Okay, the topic today

206
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,002
is whether or not
we should have children.

207
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,132
I will be taking
the affirmative.

208
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:18,302
You will be taking the negative.

209
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:21,302
Each round will be individually
scored by our judge, Captain Holt.

210
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:22,733
Do you need to hear
my credentials?

211
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:25,873
Debate moderator license
D as in delta, 8-1-0...

212
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,833
- I believe you.
- Y as in Yankee, 4-1.

213
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:30,263
J as in Juliet,
J as in Juliet, 6.

214
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:31,815
- Great.
- I have a variety of timers.

215
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,427
- Do you prefer a buzz or a ding?
- Don't care.

216
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,295
- Ding.
- Okay.

217
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:37,036
Peralta, you can present the
first argument from your, uh...

218
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:39,160
Scribbled list of feelings.

219
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:40,096
I'll have you know

220
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:42,290
that I have some
data-driven arguments as well.

221
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,480
According to a study I read,
people with kids

222
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:47,781
were less likely to report that
they were happy in their lives

223
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:49,056
than people without kids.

224
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:52,187
Now, call me crazy, but being
happy tends to make me feel,

225
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,367
uh, pretty happy.

226
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:54,300
Where did you read this study?

227
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:57,651
Well, it wasn't something I read
so much as told about.

228
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:58,831
And who told you about it?

229
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:03,001
- Hitchcock.
- Hitchcock?

230
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:03,788
- Yeah.
- That seems like

231
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,930
a pretty intellectual thing
for him to mention.

232
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:06,864
What was the context?

233
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:10,135
He had invested in a NuvaRing
competitor called Vag-a-Plug

234
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:11,777
and was practicing
his sales pitch on me.

235
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:13,827
This is your first argument?
Your opening statement?

236
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:14,626
Point to Amy.

237
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,017
All right, fine.
Forget the study.

238
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,797
I just don't want to lose
what we already have.

239
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,017
Ask anyone with children
and they'll tell you

240
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,107
children bring meaning and love
into your life.

241
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:25,377
Yes, there may be some moments
that you lose,

242
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,377
but there will also be
new moments.

243
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:28,535
Take the water park.

244
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:32,536
I would never go with you,
but you know who would?

245
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:35,069
- Your kid.
- Point to Amy.

246
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:36,645
That's not your call to make,
Peralta.

247
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:37,945
Point to Amy.

248
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,905
Okay, fine.
New Subject: work.

249
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:41,775
We both work way too much.

250
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:44,385
Why bother having kids if you
never get to spend time with them?

251
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:46,785
I mean, I love my job,
and I know you love yours,

252
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,062
and I don't think it's fair for either
of us to have to sacrifice that.

253
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:51,023
Do you know why I want to
become lieutenant so badly?

254
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:52,685
To prove your worth to
your hyper judgmental parents.

255
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:53,945
Yes, obviously that.

256
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:57,075
But also, the higher your rank,
the more control over your hours.

257
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:00,139
Plenty of people have jobs and
kids, Jake, and they find a way.

258
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,302
This has become more about
your employment status.

259
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:05,040
As your supervisor, I feel
I have a conflict of interest

260
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,181
- and should abstain from judging.
- Okay, so do we both get a point?

261
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,974
No. Kevin has been
on the phone all this time.

262
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:11,975
He's also a licensed
debate moderator.

263
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:14,625
License number
J as in Juliet, 2-5-9...

264
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:16,415
- This means nothing to me.
- H as in hotel.

265
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,155
- Z as in Zulu.
- Oh, thank God he stopped.

266
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:19,455
3-6-9.

267
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,335
- Point to Amy.
- Okay, fine.

268
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,945
You want to know why I really
don't want to have children?

269
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:27,115
I had a crappy dad.

270
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,995
I know what happens
when you mess up as a parent.

271
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,515
It's not great.

272
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:33,345
And this may come as a shock
to you, but...

273
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:35,414
I kind of have some dad issues
with certain people.

274
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:35,975
- Holt.
- Me.

275
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,417
- Raymond.
- Yeah, but not just him.

276
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:39,937
It's every male authority
figure from my entire life.

277
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:41,727
Hey, Jake, can you move
"Legends of the Fall"

278
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:42,817
from new releases into drama?

279
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:43,897
You got it, Dad.

280
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,907
Craig was only six weeks older
than me.

281
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:47,257
Since this has become about me,

282
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:49,127
I'm gonna have to abstain
from this round as well,

283
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,737
but Kevin is still standing by.

284
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:52,387
Actually, I feel as though
your personal relationship

285
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,087
with Peralta affects me too.

286
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,917
Luckily, I had Gail
standing by as well.

287
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:57,527
Oh, my God, you guys know Gail?

288
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:58,334
Who's Gail?

289
00:09:58,335 --> 00:09:59,885
Vice president
of the Debaters Club.

290
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:01,456
This is a very big deal.

291
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:02,636
Do you need to hear
my credentials?

292
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:04,554
License number
U as in uniform, 7...

293
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:06,735
No!
No more credentials, please.

294
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,125
I don't want to have
a structured debate.

295
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,785
It's an idiotic way
to decide something.

296
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,125
- What?
- How dare you?

297
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,586
- Is he insane?
- Raymond, Kevin, I'll be reporting this.

298
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:14,758
Okay, look.

299
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:17,978
Amy, I'm scared, okay?

300
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:20,572
I'm scared that we're gonna have a
child and I won't be able to handle it,

301
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,053
I'm scared that
I'm not gonna be a good father,

302
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:25,223
and I'm scared that I'll make
a mistake I can't take back.

303
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,923
Jake, I get it.
I'm scared too.

304
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:29,843
Every other big decision
I've made in my life

305
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:30,973
I was sure about:

306
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,793
becoming a cop,
asking you to marry me,

307
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,933
buying those Jordan 1s for $500.

308
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:36,673
Wait, you spent $500
on sneakers?

309
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,503
Yeah, they were so cool,
and if I had never worn them,

310
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:39,548
they would have kept
their value.

311
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,159
- So they lost their value?
- Yes, all of it.

312
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:42,769
I stepped in a puddle
as soon as I left the store.

313
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,939
But this isn't about
the Jordans.

314
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:45,419
This is about the fact

315
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,859
that I don't want to bring
a human being into this world

316
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,689
unless I'm 100% sure that
I'm ready to take care of it.

317
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:53,469
Okay?

318
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,129
Too emotional.
Point to Amy.

319
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,559
Okay, Gail is clearly biased.

320
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:58,129
I think we need a new moderator.

321
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:59,429
Bob Templeman here.

322
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,519
What? How many people
are on this phone call?

323
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,908
Hey, so Holt went to go
smooth things over with Gail.

324
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:08,259
He thinks we may just have to pay
the Debaters Guild a small fine.

325
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,349
Cool. And as you can see,
Pam is here.

326
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,619
She has some thoughts.

327
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,582
I was saying to Jake,
before Bobby,

328
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,493
I didn't think I wanted
to have kids either.

329
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:17,801
But he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

330
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,722
Hey, Pam, could you give us
a minute?

331
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,032
Oh, of course.
I'm gonna call my friend JoAnn.

332
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,902
She's been waiting for
a big update on all of this.

333
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:25,808
Great.

334
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,602
I'm sorry.
The debate was a bad idea.

335
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:34,132
I just...

336
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:36,432
I felt ambushed by the fact
that you didn't want kids,

337
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:38,092
and I thought I could fix it
with logic.

338
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,612
I mean,
what if I had won the debate?

339
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:40,962
Jake, I'm trying so hard
to be nice,

340
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:42,482
but I don't know how to respond
to that.

341
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:43,662
- Cold-blooded but fair.
- I get it.

342
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,189
You're scared.
I can't change that.

343
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,792
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'll
never change how I feel about it.

344
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,492
I mean, I used to be scared of
sushi, and now it's my favorite food.

345
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,622
I got tuna sashimi
from a pharmacy the other day.

346
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,282
- You shouldn't have.
- Yeah, it was very warm.

347
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:56,672
I got so sick.

348
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:58,852
Look, can we just press pause
on this conversation?

349
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,762
I mean, let's enjoy our lives
for a little bit,

350
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,462
and then maybe the next time
it comes up,

351
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:04,682
I'll feel differently, okay?

352
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,772
- No.
- What?

353
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,122
I need an answer from you now.

354
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,642
Like right this minute?

355
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:13,642
You can take a day or a week,

356
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,992
or maybe a month.

357
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,822
That's not a lot of time, Ames.

358
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,042
I mean, that doesn't seem
totally fair.

359
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:21,482
Well, now you know how I feel.

360
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:24,092
Women don't have the luxury
of waiting till we're 60

361
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:26,262
and then changing our minds
and getting remarried

362
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,612
and having a baby
with some dumb 28-year-old.

363
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:29,702
Oh, come on.

364
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:31,012
There's no way
I'm gonna be rich enough

365
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:33,972
that a 28-year-old
is gonna want to be with me.

366
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,232
Did that help?

367
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:36,802
Look, I don't understand
what the big deal is.

368
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:38,492
You're still young.
We have plenty of time.

369
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,932
I know, but I don't want
to wait around for two years

370
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:42,802
and then have you decide
you don't want kids,

371
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,592
'cause I don't want
to start over at 38.

372
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,592
Start over?

373
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:49,772
Like, with someone else?

374
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:02,002
- I think they're having a fight.
- No, it's not a fight,

375
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,482
it's just a devastatingly sad
conversation

376
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:06,962
about whether or not we should
have kids or just start over,

377
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,792
so you were totally wrong, Rosa.

378
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:11,792
What? You got married without
talking about if you want children?

379
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,458
Yeah, and we also got
married without discussing

380
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,182
whether or not we like water parks.

381
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:15,702
A lot of new stuff has come up,
okay, Terry?

382
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:17,322
- Why are you guys here?
- A CI came in.

383
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:18,842
There's a lot of chatter that
whoever tried to kill Rojas

384
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:19,842
is coming to finish the job.

385
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,932
- At the hospital?
- Yeah.

386
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:22,452
Holt wanted extra manpower here.

387
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:24,502
Okay, why don't you two
lock down the nurses' station

388
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,852
while Amy and I secure the room?

389
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,462
Actually,
I'd rather be with Rosa.

390
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:28,502
- Uh-oh.
- Damn, Jake.

391
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,202
Thanks a lot, Sarge.

392
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,072
You told me to sing!

393
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,552
Yeah, but what was all this?

394
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:34,382
That's just Terry being Terry.

395
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:37,292
Okay, from this vantage we can
see the elevator and the stairs.

396
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:39,552
No one should be able to get
to Rojas without us noticing.

397
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,382
- Cool.
- Hey, look, um...

398
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:43,382
I don't want you to get caught
in the middle of this stuff

399
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:44,392
between me and Jake.

400
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:45,602
I don't want you
to choose sides.

401
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,002
- Already chose. I'm with you.
- Really?

402
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,092
I didn't know you wanted kids.

403
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,262
I don't know
if I'll ever want kids,

404
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:50,652
but you should have them.
They're so cute.

405
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:52,572
It's f****** up.
Aw, it is f****** up.

406
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:53,742
Anyway, do you want me
to talk to Jake?

407
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,482
- I'm a pretty good bully.
- Thanks, but no.

408
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:58,102
I've got this covered.
I left him alone with Terry.

409
00:13:58,142 --> 00:13:59,662
That guy is
a walking advertisement

410
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:00,972
for the joys of fatherhood.

411
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:04,062
- Do not do it.
- What?

412
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:05,892
- Don't you love your girls?
- So much.

413
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,152
You should have seen Cagney
this morning

414
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,022
- with her little braids in.
- Oh.

415
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,932
But they are a ton of work, man.

416
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:13,892
If you are not totally,
100% sure you want them,

417
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:14,892
you won't survive.

418
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:16,902
- Is it really that hard?
- Yes.

419
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:19,252
I never get any sleep.
I'm always sick.

420
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,602
I never get to watch anything
I want on TV.

421
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:23,252
I still haven't finished
"Breaking Bad,"

422
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,082
but I can recite "Moana"
from memory?

423
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:28,172
"Maui, shape-shifter,
demigod of the wind and sea.

424
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:30,782
I am Moana."
Why do I know that?

425
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:32,002
I don't want to watch
kids' movies.

426
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,522
I want to watch movies
for adults.

427
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,612
Adults and teens.

428
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:36,262
And they are getting
so manipulative.

429
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:38,612
Yesterday,
Cagney pretended to be hurt,

430
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,012
I went in to help her,

431
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:42,272
and Lacey snuck in the kitchen
and stole two cookies.

432
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:44,102
Oh, my God.
Your children are monsters.

433
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:45,532
Hey, those are my kids, man.

434
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:46,712
- Back off.
- Right.

435
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,672
And the crazy part is, I really do
want to go to the water park,

436
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:51,932
but I can't give that to him
because it's the only card I hold.

437
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:53,112
Mm.

438
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:54,592
Elevator.

439
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,852
Excuse me, NYPD.
Can I see your ID?

440
00:14:58,502 --> 00:14:59,772
Amy, behind the wheelchair.

441
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,592
NYPD! Stop!

442
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,952
- Diaz for Jeffords.
- This is Terry.

443
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,212
I think we got our guy.
Colombian man,

444
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:10,652
unarmed, but he tried to run

445
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,002
as soon as we identified
ourselves.

446
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,652
And he's got a picture of Rojas
on his phone.

447
00:15:13,692 --> 00:15:15,822
We'll be right there.

448
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:17,652
No one in or out
of this hallway.

449
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,962
Why do you think that guy
is unarmed?

450
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,832
Who knows? Maybe he was
trying to smother Rojas

451
00:15:21,872 --> 00:15:23,142
or unplug his life support.

452
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:25,922
Or maybe he's a distraction,

453
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,192
and someone else is going
for the cookie jar.

454
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:29,232
What?

455
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,672
- Hi, Pam.
- Hi, Jake.

456
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,372
Don't come any closer,
or I'll blow us both up!

457
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:43,621
I'm sorry.

458
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:45,049
You weren't supposed to be here.

459
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:46,709
- This wasn't part of the plan.
- It's okay, Pam.

460
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:48,059
No need to panic.
We're just talking.

461
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:51,279
Look, I'm just gonna
put this away.

462
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:53,209
No, Terry,
don't open that, please.

463
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,189
What's going on in there?

464
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,109
There is a woman in here
with an explosive device.

465
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,239
- What? You okay?
- Yep. Everyone is fine.

466
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,239
I just need you to evacuate
this entire floor,

467
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:02,329
call ESU and the bomb squad
right away,

468
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,379
and jam all cellular
and Wi-Fi signals.

469
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:05,989
On it.

470
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,819
Okay, Pam, so we're just
gonna stay calm here

471
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:10,209
and talk this thing through
as friends.

472
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,039
This isn't supposed to be
happening.

473
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,350
The man said that I'd be able
to sneak in here unnoticed.

474
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,581
What man?
Who asked you to do this?

475
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:18,622
I didn't get his name,
but he was very attractive.

476
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:20,452
Antonio Banderas could play him
in a movie.

477
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:21,972
What has he been doing lately?

478
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,892
You know what?
He should be on "Outlander."

479
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,062
Okay, Pam,
I'm gonna cut you off,

480
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:25,982
but it's not because
I'm not interested.

481
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:27,112
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

482
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,202
I get chatty when I get nervous.

483
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,682
This man who gave you the bomb,

484
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,982
did he happen to mention
whether or not it's on a timer

485
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,372
or if there's
a remote detonator?

486
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:35,682
I don't know.
I'm terrible with electronics.

487
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:39,162
I wish my son Bobby were here.
He taught me how to iPad.

488
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:41,172
Okay, I also know how to iPad,

489
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:42,862
so maybe I could take a look.

490
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:44,122
Stay where you are!

491
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,002
The man told me
that when I got the bomb set,

492
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,042
I should text him
with this phone

493
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:49,432
and if anything went wrong,

494
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:50,782
I should push this button.

495
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,442
No, no, no, no!
You don't want to do that.

496
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:53,922
Yes, I do.
I have to.

497
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:55,442
Well, there's only one thing
to do when two people

498
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,012
have diametrically opposing
opinions on a subject.

499
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:00,012
- Structured debate.
- What?

500
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,192
Yeah, I just learned about it.

501
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:02,712
All right, I will argue
the negative:

502
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:03,752
I don't want to blow up.

503
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:05,192
And you can argue
the affirmative:

504
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,062
you do want to blow up,
which I have to say, Pam,

505
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:08,452
is a very tough stance to take.

506
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:09,542
I don't want to blow up,

507
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:11,852
but the man said
he'd give me $500,000.

508
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,552
This is so Bobby can take care
of my granddaughter.

509
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:16,462
That girl means the world to me.

510
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,512
Fine, fine.
Point to Pam.

511
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:19,032
But if you care about her
so much,

512
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,162
how can you just
blow yourself up?

513
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,162
You'll never get to see her again.

514
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:23,992
Well, at least I know she'll be
financially well taken care of.

515
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:27,042
Sure, but is this really how
you want her to remember you?

516
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,602
- As a murderer?
- I'd rather be remembered

517
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,132
as a woman who blew up
a mobster to help her family

518
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:34,782
rather than a librarian whose bowels
are tied up like a sailor's knot!

519
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:37,702
Okay, that's a very strong argument.
Very strong.

520
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:38,922
But you're forgetting one thing.

521
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:40,492
You're not just gonna be
killing a mobster.

522
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:41,922
You're also gonna be killing me.

523
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:44,142
He said the blast would only
hurt people in the room.

524
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:45,582
You could just walk right out of here.

525
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:48,322
Pam, you know I can't do that.

526
00:17:48,362 --> 00:17:51,412
- Now, please, just give me the bomb.
- And then what?

527
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:53,282
Bobby doesn't get any money
and I go to jail?

528
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,592
I can't go to jail.

529
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:56,762
Every roommate I've ever had
has hated me.

530
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,942
In college, I had a roommate
named Mary-Ellen,

531
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:01,422
and she was dating the brother
of Steve Guttenberg...

532
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:02,512
Pam, what are we talking
about here?

533
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:04,072
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.

534
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:05,422
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I know it probably feels like

535
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:06,902
you don't have a lot of options
right now.

536
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,472
In fact, this whole situation
probably feels like...

537
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:11,432
Like a twisted bowel,
but it's not.

538
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:14,082
There's still one end
of this bowel that's open.

539
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:16,262
Which end?

540
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:19,702
- The butt end.
- I'm listening.

541
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:21,962
Okay, if you hand me
that bomb right now,

542
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:25,182
nothing bad will have happened,
and that'll be because of you,

543
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:26,662
because you cooperated.

544
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:29,402
Also, I'm sure a judge
would understand

545
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,582
how you got into this situation.

546
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:32,062
I mean, you were asked
to do this

547
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:34,372
by an Antonio Banderas type.
Who could say no to that?

548
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,412
And even if you do go to prison,

549
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:38,672
it is gonna be
such a fancy prison.

550
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:42,372
- With a lot of crafts?
- Yes, with tons of crafts.

551
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,462
Pam, listen to me.

552
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:48,342
Let's untwist this bowel together.

553
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:52,172
Let's clear everything out.

554
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,352
Okay.

555
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,572
You did great, Pam.
Thank you.

556
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:05,222
Now that it's out of my hands,
I can see it really is a bomb.

557
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:06,352
Yes. Yes, it is.

558
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,972
- Oh, my God, get some help!
- Okay.

559
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:15,062
- You okay?
- Hey. Yeah, I'm okay.

560
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:18,322
Really surprised by Pam.

561
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,322
- I did not see that coming.
- Right?

562
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:22,852
You should have seen the look on
my face when I saw it was her.

563
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:24,682
Your jaw just dropped.

564
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:25,942
- Oh, she's right there.
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:28,552
Good-bye, Pam.
Good luck with everything.

566
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:30,552
- Kind of liked her in the end.
- Yeah.

567
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:34,082
- So did they defuse the bomb?
- Yeah, one of 'em.

568
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:37,042
Oh, you didn't hear?
There was a second bomb.

569
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:38,342
Ya butt.

570
00:19:38,392 --> 00:19:40,392
- Ya butt is da bomb.
- Aww.

571
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:42,692
On our anniversary.

572
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:44,612
Speaking of which,
I requested next week off

573
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:48,702
so we can take an actual vacation...
to the water park.

574
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:51,442
I've never been more in love
with you in my entire life.

575
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:58,282
And hey, I've been thinking,
and I do want to have kids.

576
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,932
With you.

577
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:04,062
- You're not scared anymore?
- Oh, no, I am so scared.

578
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:05,332
Maybe even more so than before,

579
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,502
but I was scared in there
with Pam too,

580
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:10,592
and you know, I didn't panic
or mess anything up there.

581
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,292
If anything, I was sharper.
I was a freakin' debate genius.

582
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:15,732
Debate genius?
Oh, that's very hot.

583
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,772
Oh, that's an added bonus.
Okay, keep that energy up.

584
00:20:18,822 --> 00:20:22,132
But the point that I was
actually trying to make is,

585
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:24,742
maybe it's a good thing
that I'm scared of fatherhood.

586
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:28,172
You know? Maybe it'll turn me
into a freakin' dad genius.

587
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:33,092
But we don't have to start
trying right away, right?

588
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:35,962
I mean, I don't know
that I'm all the way there yet.

589
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:37,922
No, of course not.

590
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:40,842
Whenever we're both ready.
How do you know when that is?

591
00:20:40,882 --> 00:20:42,542
I guess we'll just
have to have another one

592
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:45,282
of these really fun,
casual conversations.

593
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:46,932
Cool. Love that.
Can't wait.

594
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,892
- Can we go home now?
- Yes, please.

595
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:54,112
Maybe we can grab some Thai food
and brainstorm baby names?

596
00:20:54,162 --> 00:20:55,592
Ooh, I like that.

597
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:57,992
Now, I am a fan of the show
"American Gladiators."

598
00:20:58,032 --> 00:21:01,992
How do you feel about the name
Blaze Peralta?

599
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:03,122
Not great.

600
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:05,042
- What about Laser?
- No.

601
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:06,042
- Nitro?
- No.

602
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:07,042
- Viper?
- No.

603
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,302
- Atlas?
- Ooh, I do love atlases.

604
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,522
Mm, common ground.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
