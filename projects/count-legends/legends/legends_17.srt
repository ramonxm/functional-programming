1
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:04,352
.

2
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,049
- Guys! I have a great
idea for a prank.

3
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:07,659
Before Holt comes in

4
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,183
I'm gonna put ink on the podium
where he puts his hands.

5
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,314
- I don't think
he'll fall for that.

6
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:11,489
- I did!
- How?

7
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,664
I haven't even
opened this yet.

8
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,318
- I guess it's unrelated.

9
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:15,754
- Captain Holt hates pranks.
This is gonna backfire, man.

10
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,408
- Ugh, fine, I'll tone it down.
I'll...

11
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,019
move his podium
a foot to the left.

12
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:20,281
- What?
He'll be so angry.

13
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:21,282
- Okay, five inches.
- Five?

14
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:22,283
- Three?
- Three?

15
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:23,588
- One?
- One?

16
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:24,981
- All right.
I'll move it a half inch.

17
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,156
- Fine.
It's your funeral.

18
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,115
- Oh my god.

19
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:29,377
Worst prank ever.
So stupid.

20
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,944
Holt's not even
going to notice.

21
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:34,730
- Good morning.

22
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:37,907
- You guys--

23
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,866
the podium, it's...

24
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,739
- Ha.
[chuckles]

25
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:46,742
[laughter intensifies]

26
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:48,918
[riotous laughter]

27
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,006
[shouting]
You're crazy!

28
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,181
How did you pull this off?

29
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:54,184
[upbeat music]

30
00:00:54,228 --> 00:01:01,496
â™ª

31
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:14,074
- Yes, Kevin, they moved it
a full half inch.

32
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,901
I'll tell you
the entire story tonight.

33
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:18,208
I love you as well.
Goodbye.

34
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,210
Oh, that was a fun
several moments.

35
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,212
So, there's been
a series of homicides.

36
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,171
Three victims, all young men,

37
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:26,086
each murdered
in their own fashion.

38
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,348
- A serial killer?
How'd they do it?

39
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,306
Strangled? Mangled?
Hung, i.e. dangled?

40
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,394
- Their bodies
were disfigured.

41
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:31,526
- I.e. "mangled."
Continue.

42
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:32,744
- Our killer
cut the victims open

43
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:34,006
and ripped out their hearts.

44
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,138
Now, before I
assign this case--

45
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,531
- Five dollars!
- What?

46
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:37,923
- I'm bidding for it.
I want this so badly.

47
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,055
- That's not how we--
- $20.

48
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,622
Just to make this interesting.

49
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:42,363
- $100 for Jake to have it!
- I was going to assign

50
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,539
the case to you and Peralta
but perhaps I should

51
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,280
give it to Diaz instead.
- $200!

52
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:47,759
- It's not about
the money, Boyle!

53
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:49,674
Commissioner Kelly
is breathing down my neck.

54
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:52,199
I need this case handled
professionally and maturely.

55
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:53,983
- Name one time
I haven't acted professionally.

56
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:55,202
- You're holding a juice box.

57
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:56,812
- It stops me
from spilling my juice!

58
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,335
Look, we can handle this, sir.

59
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,337
Do we joke around sometimes?
Yes, but when it's time

60
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:01,947
to buckle down,
we're seasoned professionals.

61
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,297
- That's why they call us
the Spice Boys.

62
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,428
- They don't
and they won't.

63
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,604
Sir, I swear,
give us a chance.

64
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,606
We can get this guy.

65
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,565
- Fine.
Case goes to the Spice Boys.

66
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,306
- Please don't call us that.
- Too late.

67
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,698
Spice Boy train
has left the station.

68
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:14,612
Toot toot!

69
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,048
- Hey, hey, check it out.

70
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,702
It's my lieutenant
start paperwork!

71
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,313
- It's gonna be so weird
not calling you Sarge anymore.

72
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,315
- Maybe I'll go by Loot.
"Morning, Loot!"

73
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,317
"Loot over here."
"Let's invite Loot!"

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,927
What do you think?

75
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,538
- I bet you're
excited about

76
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,453
the raise that comes
with your promotion.

77
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,890
- Well, Terry doesn't like
to talk about money, but, uh...

78
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,588
Cha-ching!
[laughs]

79
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,198
Now I can pay for Showtime.

80
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,765
Find out who or what
"SMILF" is!

81
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,375
- You know, some people say,
"Mo money, mo problems,"

82
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:40,072
but those people are idiots.
Money's amazing.

83
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,465
- Wait, what?

84
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:42,858
This says there's
not enough money

85
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,816
in the Nine-Nine's budget
for my raise!

86
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,991
- What does that mean?

87
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,471
- They're going to
transfer me!

88
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,649
- Now, I know
what you're thinking.

89
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:53,782
[dumb voice]
Where'd dem guts go?

90
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:54,652
- Uh, yeah.

91
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,001
- This guy needs a dentist,

92
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,786
because he's got
a big ol' cavity.

93
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,353
- [laughs] I love that.
I'm stealing it.

94
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,137
- You cannot steal
what is a gift.

95
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,487
- Thank you.
Okay, so whoever did this,

96
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:05,402
they weren't careful
with the organs.

97
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,883
They just sorta grabbed
whatever and yanked.

98
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:10,102
- Title of your sex tape.
Oh, that's just something

99
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,582
we say back at the Nine-Nine.

100
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,149
- Interesting, 'cause around
here sex tape is what

101
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,152
we call the adhesive you use
to reattach a severed penis.

102
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,023
- Oh, I'll have to
pick some of that up.

103
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,721
- Why?
- Anyway...

104
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:22,811
most of the killer's incisions
are very sloppy but then once

105
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,900
he gets to the heart
they become very careful.

106
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:27,859
I mean, look at the vena cava.
That's a clean cut.

107
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:29,209
Game recognize game.

108
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,167
- Hmm. I like your style,
Doctor Cox.

109
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,169
- Gentlemen!
The Commissioner would like

110
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,431
a status update on the case.

111
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,867
- Oh, come on Ray.
You make it sound like

112
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,782
I'm puttin' the screws to ya.
No, I just popped in

113
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,741
to say if you don't
solve these murders immediately

114
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:42,439
there's gonna be some
serious consequences.

115
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:46,008
[laughs]
I'm just messin' with ya!

116
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:48,228
Listen, you know what would
help you catch this guy?

117
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,360
I just launched a new app,
HotClues.

118
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,535
Are you familiar with it?

119
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,015
- The one that
allows civilians

120
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,278
to submit anonymous tips
directly to the NYPD?

121
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:57,628
Yes, I'm familiar with...
HotClues.

122
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,326
- Great!
You know, it's actually

123
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,719
helped us solve 17 cases,
so I think we should ask

124
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,243
for the public's help
with this one.

125
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,375
- No, study after study has
shown that soliciting

126
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,552
anonymous tips results in false
leads and wrongful convictions.

127
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,901
- Hmm.
Tell me how you really feel.

128
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,382
- I did.
- And I loved it! Such passion!

129
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:13,862
But I think HotClues
could help us here.

130
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,125
- No, we will solve
this case the proper way

131
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,215
with actual police work
conducted by the two best

132
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,783
detectives in the NYPD.
- Captain!

133
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:24,568
- Well, I certainly hope
your methods work.

134
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,136
For the sake
of your careers.

135
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:29,094
[cheerfully]
Bye now.

136
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:32,010
- Oof! Now that guy's
gonna need some sex tape.

137
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:34,143
- [in unison] 'Cause someone's
gonna cut his penis off.

138
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,014
- We are vibing!

139
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:37,973
- So...
I found out where

140
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,366
they're transferring me.

141
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,629
And, you know, I'm feeling
pretty good about it.

142
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:43,326
- Oh! Somewhere nice?
Upper West Side?

143
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,459
- No, even better.

144
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,895
Staten Island!

145
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:49,550
- [bursts out laughing]
Good one, Loot.

146
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,769
Where you really going?
- No, I'm serious. Staten!

147
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,293
- Wait, they're transferring
you out of New York?

148
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,685
- It's part of the City!

149
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,513
- Is it, though?
- Hey, Staten Island is great.

150
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:59,429
It's got parks,
loads of bike paths,

151
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,692
tons of up and coming
restaurants...

152
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,651
I mean...
easy access to New Jersey!

153
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,479
- You're lying.
Your right pec is popping

154
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,655
all over the place.
We all know that's your tell.

155
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:09,613
- Of course I'm lying!
It's Staten Island!

156
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,006
The precinct
is the One-Two-Two.

157
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,443
How the hell am I supposed
to chant One-Two-Two?

158
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:16,316
One-Two-Two!
One-Two-Two!

159
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,274
I sound like a damn
choo-choo train!

160
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,363
- Detectives, how's the case?
Any breakthroughs?

161
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,452
- Uh, well, we're still
in the early stages.

162
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,280
- Do you have a suspect
or DNA evidence?

163
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,803
- Oh my god.
I wish.

164
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,979
- Look, we need to solve
this to prove to that idiot

165
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:31,461
John Kelly, how inane
and useless his little app is.

166
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,941
- Oh dip.
I see what's going on.

167
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,160
Holt is feeling petty.
- I'm not being petty.

168
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,379
I can assure you my feelings

169
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,815
about John Kelly
are purely professional.

170
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,643
- Are they?
Because every time his name

171
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,341
is brought up in our group text
thread you immediately send

172
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,646
back a super catty GIF
of some lady

173
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,344
from "The Durrells in Corfu"
rolling her eyes.

174
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,736
- That's Louisa Durrell,
exasperated by

175
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,347
the pace of life on Corfu!

176
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,391
- Wait, the group
text thread is back?

177
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:49,697
- No.
- We misspoke.

178
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,220
- Yeah.
- Look, if you can't solve

179
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:52,874
this case I'll reassign
it to someone who can.

180
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,354
- Wait, no, no, no, no, no!
I have an idea.

181
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,007
We need to get
into the mind of a sicko.

182
00:05:56,051 --> 00:06:00,534
And the only way to do that is
with the help of another sicko.

183
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:03,537
[intense music]

184
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,670
â™ª

185
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,672
- Jake!
It's so good to see you!

186
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:10,805
Come give me a hug,
I'm not going to eat you!

187
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,851
Also, don't hug me
'cause I will try to eat you.

188
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:16,332
.

189
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,160
- This is such a surprise!

190
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,596
I haven't seen you
since I transferred here.

191
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,945
How's Amy?
- She's great!

192
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,817
We're married
and she's a Sergeant now.

193
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,601
- Wow!
- Yeah! How's everything here?

194
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:26,168
- You know, same old same old.

195
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,562
Guess who's here? Herman.
- Herman!

196
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,912
Always playing Yahtzee,
knew everybody's name.

197
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,130
- Worshipped Satan.
- Did he?

198
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,698
He never mentioned that.
[laughter]

199
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,266
- He wouldn't shut up about it.
- It is exhausting.

200
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,529
- Well, I'm Charles.
I'm Jake's best friend.

201
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,662
Charles, he's serving three
life sentences.

202
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,272
No need to flex.
So Caleb, we're tracking

203
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,753
a serial killer
and I was thinking

204
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,494
you could help us
get inside his head.

205
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:48,756
- Just because I ate humans

206
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,453
doesn't mean that
I'm inhuman, Jake.

207
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:51,933
- Caleb, come on.
That's not what I meant.

208
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,195
- I'm just kidding.

209
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,066
I'm probably friends
with the guy online.

210
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,459
[chuckles]
What's his deal?

211
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,896
- Well, he's been
murdering young men

212
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,463
and cutting out their hearts.

213
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,682
- Ew.
What?

214
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:02,813
I would never eat a heart.

215
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,293
I stick to the normal stuff.

216
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:05,425
Butts and thighs.

217
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,992
One time I ate a foot,
but it was nasty.

218
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,385
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You know what?

219
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,779
There was some weird guy
on the forum recently.

220
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,302
- The forum?
- Yeah, it's a chat room

221
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,609
for people who like to talk
about eating human beings

222
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,132
but definitely won't act on it.

223
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:18,960
Wink.
Yeah, it's hosted on--

224
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,483
- [together] Reddit.
- Obviously.

225
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,616
Anyways, he showed up from out
of nowhere asking questions

226
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,052
about cutting out hearts.
- Really?

227
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,314
Do you know
anything else about him?

228
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:26,881
- I'd never seen him
on there before

229
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,839
but you could check the logs.
I'll approve you.

230
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,275
I'm an admin.
- Ah.

231
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,103
- Oh, you might want to switch
to incognito mode.

232
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:35,629
Otherwise your targeted ads will
be pretty cannibal-specific.

233
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:36,891
- Ah, good to know.

234
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,501
Well, it was good
to see you, Caleb.

235
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,676
Send me that info.

236
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,939
[all screaming]

237
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,594
Hey Terry, you okay?
You skipped all your lunches.

238
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,596
- I'm going through the budget
to see if there's any way

239
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,380
we could save enough money
for me to stay here.

240
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,339
- You find anything yet?
- Yeah, we could

241
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:54,038
switch to generic printer ink,
cut down on custodial services,

242
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,997
and stop buying
office birthday cakes.

243
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,216
- Over my dead body!
- It's just an idea.

244
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,392
- Well, take it off the table!
- Damn, Scully, fine.

245
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:01,872
- We could stop paying
for an exterminator.

246
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,134
It's pointless.
We all have guns.

247
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:04,658
- Who am I kidding?

248
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,181
We'll never save enough
to keep me at the Nine-Nine.

249
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,922
- You're right.
The only way to free up

250
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,663
that money
is if you fire someone.

251
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:12,535
- What? I can't just fire
someone without cause.

252
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,537
- Come on.
We all know there's a bunch of

253
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:15,712
dead weight around here.

254
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:18,410
Sloppy paperwork,
penmanship fails,

255
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:20,630
phone etiquette that
makes me want to barf.

256
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,023
Let's axe a dud!

257
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,286
- Damn, Amy.
I am loving this shade on you.

258
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,809
But Loot's right.
We can't just fire somebody.

259
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:29,378
That said, you could
"inspire" somebody to quit.

260
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,641
For example, Broadway Brian.

261
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,861
- Yes!
Broadway Brian, of course!

262
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:35,515
- Who the hell
is Broadway Brian?

263
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:36,907
- Brian in records.

264
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,388
He's always talking about
what a great singer he is

265
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,521
and how his dream
is to be in musicals.

266
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,175
You just need to convince him
to go for his dream.

267
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,395
- Oh, I don't know.
That feels underhanded.

268
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,049
- It's never underhanded to help
somebody follow their dream.

269
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:49,529
Yesterday,
I was watching "Ellen,"

270
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,400
and she had this woman on
who wanted to be a chef,

271
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,054
but she didn't have any taste
buds, so she quit her job,

272
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:54,577
hired her best friend
to be her taste tester.

273
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,057
And now they have the best taco
truck in Lansing.

274
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,667
It was inspiration as [bleep].

275
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,103
- Yeah.

276
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,931
I'd just be helping him
follow his dream!

277
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,585
I'd be doing him a favor!

278
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:06,371
I'm going to inspire Brian's
ass right out of this office!

279
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:07,721
For him, not me.

280
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:09,984
Dreams, and whatnot, you know.

281
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,594
- Detectives,
Commissioner Kelly is back

282
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,422
and he found his way here
on his own

283
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,206
without any tips
from the public.

284
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,295
How impressive is that?
- Well, thank you, Raymond.

285
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,514
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

286
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,124
Thought I'd check
on your progress.

287
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,300
[phone chimes]
- Um, we have a solid lead.

288
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:23,954
Suspicious online behavior

289
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,174
from someone using the name
Jamburger77.

290
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,002
- There's only one person
in the tri-state area

291
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,786
with that surname--
Eileen Jamburger.

292
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,876
101 years old, and immediately
racist on the phone.

293
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,399
She is not a suspect
at this time.

294
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,619
- But the user did make
one non-cannibal post.

295
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:40,449
A negative review of the
headroom in a 2006 Saturn Ion.

296
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:41,885
- Real creep car.

297
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,235
So, we pulled records
on every 2006 Ion in the city

298
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,759
and we're following up
on them now.

299
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,108
- Well, I'll be.

300
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:48,675
That's some nice police work,
Peralta.

301
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,285
- And Charles.
- I especially like how

302
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:52,113
you found evidence,
followed up on it,

303
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:53,941
and it's lead you closer
to a solve.

304
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,812
- No, I agree, Peralta.
It's excellent work.

305
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,422
- You must've hated
saying that.

306
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,468
- No, I didn't.
I like giving compliments.

307
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,297
You have a nice deep voice.
It is very commanding.

308
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,126
- Cut the crap, John.
You're furious!

309
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,650
And everyone can tell!

310
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,696
- See?
Very commanding.

311
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:13,134
So, I know Raymond has
some issues with HotClues,

312
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,092
but we did put
the call out on the app

313
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:17,312
and got a very promising tip.

314
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:19,227
- Look, we're not going
against our Captain.

315
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,970
- So this guy says
he saw someone covered in blood

316
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:24,711
getting out of a Saturn Ion.

317
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,321
But you don't need that tip

318
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:29,716
because you are among the
best detectives in the NYPD!

319
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,500
[laughter]

320
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:35,069
- You're right,
we don't need that tip!

321
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,679
But seriously,
send us that tip.

322
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:37,941
We need it.

323
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:39,551
- Hey, Brian!
What are you up to?

324
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,379
- Typing in numbers
into a computer.

325
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,991
Like I always do endlessly
for 40-60 hours a week.

326
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,209
- Well, when you love
what you do,

327
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:46,950
you don't work
a day in your life!

328
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,518
Unless, do you not love
sad data entry?

329
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,302
- Well,
my passion is performing.

330
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:52,695
I do musical theater.

331
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,479
It's the hardest form of acting.
- I agree!

332
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,917
I am always saying,
if you're not singing,

333
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,875
you're not acting.
- Right!

334
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,311
- It's probably hard
to audition

335
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,009
because you're always here,
right?

336
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:05,186
- Yes! I had to pass up a chance
to read for "Seussical."

337
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,014
- You know Brian,
this makes me think

338
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,363
of something I saw on "Ellen."

339
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,018
There was this lady,
she wanted to be a cook,

340
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:12,846
but her tongue
was all messed up,

341
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,979
and she had this friend
who didn't even have a tongue--

342
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,459
I mean, she did,

343
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:21,028
and now they own a taco truck
in Lansing!

344
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,333
- Huh?

345
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,726
- Follow your dreams, man!

346
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,206
You gotta follow your dreams.

347
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,469
Find your taco truck!

348
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,211
- Wow.
Thank you.

349
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,126
That gives me
a lot to think about.

350
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,475
So what did you
come down here for?

351
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:38,001
- Oh, uh, I had to borrow...

352
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,350
the water cooler!

353
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:41,309
[grunting] All right.
Thanks, Brian.

354
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,006
Think about what I said.

355
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,922
- So, the tipster saw
the Saturn parked out back

356
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,228
and the woman at the desk said

357
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,751
it belongs to the man
in room 203.

358
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,362
One "Larry Bird."
- Obvious fake name.

359
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,408
- Or is it so insane that
there's no way it's fake?

360
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,931
If you're trying not
to draw attention,

361
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,672
why not go with something
like "John Smith?"

362
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,760
- From "Pocahontas"?

363
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,719
Uh, yeah.
Way to fly under the radar.

364
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:00,632
[laughs]

365
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,460
- Excuse me, is there ice yet?

366
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:03,766
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't work here.

367
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,376
I'm a police officer.

368
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,074
- Well, then I'd like
to lodge a formal complaint.

369
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,597
There hasn't been ice here
for days

370
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,512
and everyone knows
my wine coolers are supposed

371
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,079
to be served chilled.
- You're an adult.

372
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,428
Why are you
drinking wine coolers?

373
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,082
- Because I'm on vacation.
- Okay.

374
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,040
Well, I'll mention the ice.

375
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:18,607
- Thanks.
Pig.

376
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,087
- Okay.

377
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,002
[phone ringing]

378
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:23,394
- Oh, it's Holt.

379
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:24,395
I didn't tell him
what we were doing.

380
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,788
- I'll act natural.

381
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,137
- You're not gonna be
on the phone call.

382
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,356
Just do nothing.
Hey, Captain!

383
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,923
- What delicious water
I'm drinking!

384
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,707
- [growls] Sorry that we didn't
check in before we left.

385
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,274
We're just down
at the DMV following up

386
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:34,841
on the Saturn owners.
- Lies!

387
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,843
- Captain!
How'd you know we were here?

388
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,192
- I followed you!

389
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,846
John Kelly gave you
a "Hot Clue," didn't he?

390
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,238
How dare you disobey me.

391
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,631
- Come on, sir,
it was a good tip

392
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,980
and we're trying
to catch a serial killer.

393
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,329
- Well then let's see
this tip,

394
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,505
this groundbreaking tip

395
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,029
that threatens
to blow the case wide open.

396
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,335
- Okay, I know this tone.
Here comes petty Holt.

397
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,510
- Naw, bitch.
I'm not being petty.

398
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:53,860
- You just said, "naw, bitch."

399
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,818
- Show me the tip.
- [exasperated sigh]

400
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,515
[whispers]
Title of your sex tape.

401
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,039
- I was behind
the Royal Motor Inn.

402
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,911
I saw a guy get out
of a blue Saturn Ion

403
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,260
and he was covered in blood.

404
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,696
Anyway, Baba Booey!

405
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,655
- Baba Booey?
Is that a clue?

406
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:08,831
- Uh, I don't know what
Baba Booey means, actually.

407
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,181
- It's a popular prank phrase
from Howard Stern.

408
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,488
- Charles!
- Oh, from a shock jock.

409
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,837
Well, that changes everything.

410
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,797
Now we have
a credible break in the case.

411
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,146
Baba Booey!

412
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,843
[hard knocking]
NYPD, open up!

413
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,192
- Uh, just a minute!

414
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,499
- Ooh, I bet
he's frantically packing up

415
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,892
his collection of hearts.

416
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:27,415
[glass breaking]

417
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,373
- Goin' in!
Get back.

418
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,812
- There's blood everywhere!
- He went out the window.

419
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,944
- I'll go around back.

420
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,294
- Fine, Kelly found the
murderer's kill room.

421
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,340
Whoop-dee-doo!
Should we throw him a parade?

422
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,342
- Yeah!
Maybe!

423
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:43,997
.

424
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,912
- Patrols have searched
a five-block radius.

425
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,522
No sign of the perp.

426
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,045
- And there were no prints.
He was wearing gloves.

427
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,438
- Like the inimitable
Audrey Hepburn.

428
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:52,048
- Nope.
- Gentlemen, there's something

429
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,789
I need to say.
I gave you such a hard time

430
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,792
about using Commissioner Kelly's
app because I was being petty.

431
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,012
I wanted him to fail
and I took it out on you

432
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:03,016
and for that I am very...

433
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,322
- Oh. You kind of trailed off
there, sir.

434
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,063
Were you going
to finish your sentence?

435
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,456
It felt like you were going
to say you were sorry.

436
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,979
- I did.
Boyle heard it.

437
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,807
- Uh, I would remember if
someone said my catch phrase.

438
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,896
- Fine, I'm sorry.

439
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,898
I'm very sorry.

440
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,900
- Apology accepted.

441
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,076
I am so proud of you.
- Peralta.

442
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,382
- You're right.
I'll rub it in later.

443
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,905
What matters now
is solving this case.

444
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,385
Now, our murderer
may have gotten away,

445
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,300
but we did find
his kill room.

446
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,128
Maybe there's something in here
that we're not seeing, yet.

447
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,043
- Perhaps we should pay your
cannibal friend another visit.

448
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,828
- I wouldn't say they're friends
so much as ex-cellmates.

449
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,482
- No, it's true.
We're friends.

450
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:37,615
- He ate kids!
- Well, people are complicated.

451
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,834
- Now, I'll tell you one thing.

452
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,270
You are not looking
for a cannibal.

453
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,055
- Why do you say that?
- With all that blood?

454
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,927
- No self-respecting cannibal
would waste all that sauce.

455
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,407
- See, Charles?
He's a foodie, like you.

456
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,844
- Who are you?
- Can I see that picture again?

457
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890
Oh man, those are
some nice tools.

458
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,543
I would love
to spread some ribs

459
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:53,936
using that sternum retractor,

460
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,242
but they only sell those
to hospitals.

461
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,157
- Wait a minute.
What did you just say?

462
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,246
- I said I'd love
to get my little fingies

463
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,464
in some chesties.

464
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:01,944
- No, no, no.
Not the super gross part.

465
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,163
Surgery-grade tools,

466
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:04,338
precise incisions
around the heart,

467
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,035
and there was no ice
at the motel.

468
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,950
- Because the perp was using
it for the hearts.

469
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,952
- We're not looking
for a serial killer.

470
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,867
He stole the hearts
for a transplant!

471
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,260
- Boom!
We solved it.

472
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,610
Boyle, give me a hug.
- Yeah!

473
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,004
[all screaming]
- No!

474
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:20,180
- Hey, I did it!

475
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:22,182
I talked to Brian and encouraged
him to pursue his dreams.

476
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,705
- Really?
Is he gonna quit?

477
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,272
- I don't know,
that was the first step.

478
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,143
But I figure
if I talk to him twice a day

479
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,145
for the next few weeks--
- Attention, everyone!

480
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,278
Today will be my final day
at the Nine-Nine.

481
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,975
- Damn, Loot.
That was fast.

482
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,455
- I will be taking my talents
to Broadway

483
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,457
and I owe it all
to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords.

484
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,111
- All I did was
believe in you.

485
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,416
- And it changed everything.

486
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,853
So Lieutenant,
this one's for you.

487
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,290
- Oh.

488
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,118
- [off-key]
â™ª Another opening

489
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,423
â™ª Another show

490
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,643
- Uh oh.
- â™ª From Philly, Boston

491
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:49,905
â™ª To Baltimore

492
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,472
- Amy, you said he could sing.

493
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,691
- I didn't say he could sing.
He said he could sing.

494
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,258
- â™ª Dance break!

495
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,133
- What have I done?

496
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,483
- Bye, Jake!
- Here it is.

497
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,441
The federal heart transplant
waiting list.

498
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,053
Check out who's all the way
down at 2,319.

499
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:10,230
Angelo Rinaldi, who runs
the Rinaldi crime family.

500
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,884
- Well.
Then let's pay him a visit.

501
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,234
[bangs]

502
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,671
- NYPD!
- Hands where we can see them!

503
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,281
- There's a heart
in the cooler.

504
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,892
- Sorry, Rinaldi, the only
transplant happening today

505
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,416
is your ass to jail.

506
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,070
He is definitely unconscious
and didn't hear any of that.

507
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:26,159
But I'm still pumped.
Case closed. Let's go!

508
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,596

trigger-man stealing hearts

509
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,815
so he could have a transplant.

510
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,948
That is fun!
Good job, Ray.

511
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,254
- Thank you,
Commissioner Kelly.

512

the trailing off thing again.

Um...and I owe you an apology.

515
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,482
I'm sorry and I must admit,

Pretty nifty.

You a Stern fan, Micah?

You're the guy from the video.

533
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,082
You called in the tip.

534

Yeah.

Ah, Micah, do me a favor.

537

Nobody in or out.

Lock the doors.
Thanks, bud.

539
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,135
- Actually Micah, you wanna
leave that door unlocked

540

- What's going on, Kelly?

545
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,929
Why is your assistant
submitting tips?

546
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,800
- Because they already
had the information.

547
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,411
The tips aren't coming
from the public at all.

548
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,629
- Oh, cool theory.

549
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:47,283
But if I already had
the information,

550
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,764
why am I pouring so much money
into developing this app?

551
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,200
- To hide
where you're getting it.

552
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:54,029
- Because you're using
illegal wiretaps or something!

553
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,640
- You got me! [laughs]
You guys are good!

554
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:59,034
I just love how you ping pong
off each other.

555
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,341
- This is blatantly
unconstitutional.

556
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:03,125
I'm going to the press!
- Yes, you should.

557
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,867
But first, do you know
what a stingray is?

558
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,129
- Of course we know
what a Stingray is.

559
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,522
Tenderest meat in the ocean!

560
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,480
- No, stingray is
a portable cell tower.

561
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,003
You drive it around the city.

562
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:14,310
It captures data from any
cell phone within reach.

563
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:18,488
Like, oh, text messages,
location history, voicemail...

00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,881
- Oh my god.

565
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,491
You have a
"Dark Knight" machine!

566
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,145
- Yes, I do,
and the three of you

567
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,191
are not going
to say a word about it

568
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,757
because the 18 felons

569
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:29,064
we captured through the system,
they'd go free.

570
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,544
- That's unfortunate,
but it's better

571
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:31,762
than living
in a police state.

572
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,460
I'm not sitting on this.
- Okay.

573
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:35,853
But I can assure you, you can't
prove this program exists.

574
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,420
It's just your word
against mine.

575
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,335
- I'm more than fine with that.
- You shouldn't be.

576
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:42,164
Because I can prove you'd do
anything to sabotage me.

577
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,167
My stingray
captured your texts, too.

578
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,517
- No, he has
the "Durrells in Corfu" GIF!

579
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,389
- Oh-ho-ho.
Way worse.

I can't let him quit his job!

587
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,447
He'll never get cast
in anything.

588
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,145
- Maybe he'll be one
of those people on "The Voice"

589
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,885
that's so bad they become
an Internet sensation.

590
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,713
- That's not what they do
on "The Voice", Amy,

591
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,193
that's "American Idol"!

592
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,064
"The Voice" is purely
a celebration of talent.

593
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,892
- If he wants to pursue his
dream and it doesn't work out,

00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,199
that's not on you.
He made his choice.

- Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You know, no blood on my hands.

I just need to let him
do his thing.

- Terry...
- Hey, Brian!

598
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:26,687
- So, what did you think
of my song?

599
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,386
- I loved how loud it was.
- Thank you.

I wouldn't have had the courage
to do it without you.

Sure, I daydream
about it all the time,

602
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,436
but being a single dad,
I always chickened out.
