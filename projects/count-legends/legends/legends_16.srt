1
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:06,003
         - Hey, hey hey!

2
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:06,003
  It's the best day of the year.

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,001
      Happy Cinco de Mayo!

4
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,007
- I don't think you're allowed

5
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:12,008
to wear a poncho
to work, Hitchcock.

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:13,023
         - Let's fiesta!

7
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:15,013
          [band playing
     "The Mexican Hat Song"]

8
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:16,021
- Oh, you got a band.

9
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,009
- Stop, stop!
No trumpets!

10
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:23,005
Not today!
My head is killing me!

11
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,003
               - Hit the tequila
            a little early, huh?

12
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:27,007
- I'm not hung over, Hitchcock.
I've got a tension headache.

13
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,013
I've got
the Lieutenant's exam tonight.

14
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:30,007
I'm stress-eating like crazy.

15
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:32,013
I had ten hard-boiled
egg yolks this morning.

16
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:34,005
             - Gross.
   - You're having a high-grade

17
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,015
pre-test freak out.

18
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:38,001
I've been there.
March 13, 2001.

19
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:39,007
         AP Calc test--

20
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:40,015
- Ames, I hate to cut you off,

21
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:42,010
but we all know where
this story's going.

22
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,014
            - Oh, yeah? You know
         that I crapped my pants

23
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:45,006
      in the middle of the test?

24
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:46,016
- Oh my God, no, I thought
you were just gonna say

25
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:47,022
you got a B+ or something.

26
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,022
        - More like a BM.
             - Noice.

27
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:52,014
 - Come on, now Terry's worried
 about his test and his bowels!

28
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:54,008
   - What you need, Sergeant, is
           to distract yourself.

29
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:57,001
              NPR has a riveting
              six hour interview

30
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,010
         with Eileen Moon Myers.

31
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,004
     - Nobody knows who that is.

32
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:01,017
- Nobody knows the Associate
Principal Cellist in the

33
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,014
New York Philharmonic?
[snorts] Okay.

34
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:06,005
       - Wait! I've got it!
  I know how to distract Terry.

35
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,006
       Captain, remember how you
    cancelled the last Halloween

36
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,014
    heist because there was that
    emergency gas line explosion

37
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,005
             and you said we had
                  to "help out"?

38
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,016
- Yes,
I also remember you

39
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:15,014
refusing to believe
the explosion was real.

40
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:17,008
- Go back to acting school,
buddy.

41
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,009
You're way overselling
the pain here.

42
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,014
No one's buying it!

43
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,002
           Well, it's not like I
                    was the only

44
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:23,013
                 one who thought
                    it was fake.

45
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:26,012
- And the Oscar goes to...
Trent!

46
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:30,007
       - You said that we should
        reschedule the heist for

47
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:34,005
  another day, so why not today?
     To help distract Terry?

48
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:36,005
      - Yes! And I would love to
         defend my crown after I

49
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:37,015
    destroyed you all last year.

50
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:40,015
- Well, I mean, the proposal
was all part of my plan.

51
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:42,018
         - All I remember is you
     bowing to me on your knees.

52
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,010
- Yeah, I was asking you
to marry me.

53
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,018
   - Well, you look like a fool.

54
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:47,015
- Neither of you won
because Jake swapped out

55
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,010
the real championship
cummerbund--

56
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,011
             - Belt.

57
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:52,007
- For the treacly proposal one.

58
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,014
        - What? I thought
       everyone loved that

59
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:55,007
         I used the heist
       to do the proposal.

60
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:56,023
- You are wrong--everyone hated
it--but it helped me win.

61
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:59,002
During your engagement
celebration, I snuck back

62
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,015
and found the
original cummerbund.

63
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,003
             - Belt.

64
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:03,017
- It's hanging up in
my living room at home.

65
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:05,016
    - I never thought I'd say
    this, but enough foreplay!

66
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:06,016
     Are we heisting or not?

67
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:08,012
              - Yes!
           - Of course!

68
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:10,010
   - Wait, I will only do this
       under one condition.

69
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,010
  Sergeant Jeffords agrees that
    this will help his nerves.

70
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,010
  -Yeah, I mean, I would like to
    take my mind off the test.

71
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,006
  And maybe I'll win this year!

72
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:20,000
         - Ah, the heist
       is already working.

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,018
      Sergeant Jeffords has
  recovered his sense of humor.

74
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:23,003
            [laughter]
              - Hey!

75
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:24,008
- All right,
but for real, though.

76
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:25,010
Are we doing this?

77
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,010
        -We're doing this!
             - Heist!

78
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,012
            - Heist!
            - Heist!

79
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:29,012
  - It's a Cinco de Mayo heist!

80
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:31,008
- A Cinco de Mayo heist

81
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:32,011
makes just as much sense
as Halloween!

82
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,011
Let's do it!

83
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,011
          [upbeat music]

84
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:55,005
      - Welcome one and all

85
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:59,012
 to the first ever Cinco de Mayo
        Halloween Heist 6!

86
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,004
       We're still working
          on the title.

87
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:02,013
      - No need, I love it!
      - Thank you, Charles.

88
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,011
 Now, before we go any further,

89
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:06,001
    we should probably choose
        an item to steal.

90
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,012
         Does anyone have
    anything valuable on them?

91
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,005
       Maybe some jewelry?

92
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,011
     - I have a medical alert
    bracelet that tells people

93
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:14,007
     my name and address, in
  case I have a brain collapse.

94
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:16,004
 - Perfect, this year's champion
 will be whoever's in possession

95
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:18,019
    of Scully's very upsetting
  bracelet at midnight tonight.

96
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,009
    - I take my test at 6:30.
     - You know what, Terry?

97
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:21,017
           You're kind of making
               this a nightmare.

98
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:23,012
                  Maybe you just
          shouldn't participate.

99
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:24,016
- So this really isn't about
helping out Sergeant Jeffords?

100
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,019
             - What?
        - I guess I'm out.

101
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,007
 - But--no, no, no, no, come on.

102
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,010
              Of course I'm 100%
            in support of Terry.

103
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,018
           In fact, I'm going to
               team up with him.

104
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:32,004
- [laughs]
Let's do this!

105
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,018
- You are so easily
manipulated.

106
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:35,018
Now you're stuck with
Sergeant Dumb Dumb.

107
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:37,002
            -Damn it.
              - Hey.

108
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:39,010
- Santiago,
shall we join forces?

109
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,014
    - Ooh, smart, teaming up
    with the reigning champ.

110
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,005
     - Again with this nonsense?
         I'm the reigning champ.

111
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:47,018
          The only thing you won
    last heist was a lifetime of

112
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,006
          mediocre heterosexual
          intercourse with Jake.

113
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,014
- [gasps]
How dare you.

114
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:53,010
No one thinks you won
last year.

115
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,008
  - Wow, really thought the "how
       dare you" was going to be

116
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,006
              linked to his mean
          sex comment, but okay.

117
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,002
- Right, sorry.
I'll have you know

118
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:02,002
Jake and I wear each other out
every single night.

119
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:04,002
  - Good lord, overcompensating.
                  You know what?

120
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,014
        Maybe we just shouldn't
        talk about this at work.

121
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:08,013
       - I'm texting Kevin
     to bring the cummerbund.

122
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:11,003
  You'll see who the real winner
     is, you braggy breeders.

123
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,006
      - A lot of infighting.
      Not too late to ditch

124
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:16,003
       Amy and team up with
      this pussycat burglar.

125
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:17,018
         - Please, Boyle,
       your only value was

126
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:19,013
     you had a doppelganger
     which no longer matters

127
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:21,007
        since Bill died in
          that accident.

128
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,015
           - RIP, Bill.
            - So sad.

129
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:24,015
     - I can still be useful
          without Bill!

130
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,011
       No hole's too tight
       for these tiny tips.

131
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:28,015
            [groaning]
       For stealing stuff!

132
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:30,011
            - [sighs]
          - Well, fine.

133
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,003
   Looks like I'll just team up
       with my friend Rosa.

134
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:33,019
                      - I'm out.
         Five heists was enough.

135
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,009
           We've exhausted every
      possibility of this thing.

136
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,022
           Literally nothing new
                     can happen.

137
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:38,011
                    It's boring.

138
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,015
       You can have a long lunch
                with me instead.

139
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:41,011
- Ooh, lunch?
The devil's breakfast.

140
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:42,022
        - Well, forget it.
  - Okay, I won't call it that!

141
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,013
        I just want to be
      included in something!

142
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:47,003
- Okay, that whole lunch thing
was clearly a ploy.

143
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,011
But even still, I'm not
worried about losing to Boyle.

144
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:51,004
          - No one is.
          He's a joke.

145
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:52,016
                All right, let's
           get this thing going.

146
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:54,016
           Scully will be locked
            in the supply closet

147
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:56,019
        with his bracelet.
  - Can I lie down on the floor?

148
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,007
           - Uh, yeah.
  You can do whatever you want.

149
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,022
    And you're already on the
             ground.

150
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:01,015
         With Hitchcock.
    And you both have pillows.

151
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:03,022
        - Best day ever!

152
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,020
             - There.
      Now they're locked in.

153
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,008
           Arrange your affairs.

154
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,022
                The heist begins
                in five minutes.

155
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:10,016
- Five minutes? But this whole
thing was so last second!

156
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:12,012
I don't even have
any plans or supplies!

157
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,020
                  I have so many
             plans and supplies.

158
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,008
    I even have a victory banner

159
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,016
               that unfurls with
                a voice command.

160
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,007
               I can't say what,
               but it's so cool.

161
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,006
- I thought this was
a spur-of-the-moment fun way

162
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:22,008
to distract me from freaking
out about my exam!

163
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:23,020
       - Well, it wasn't exactly
         hard to predict, Sarge.

164
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,004
            Your catchphrase is
            "Terry hates tests."

165
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:27,019
- It's true.
Terry hates tests!

166
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,006
             - But the point is,
           I planned everything,

167
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:30,018
                   starting with
              Scully's bracelet.

168
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:32,008
          It had to be the prize
         because I have prepared

169
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:33,017
             the greatest reveal
               in heist history.

170
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:36,012
 Allow me to introduce you to...

171
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,016
          Other Scully.

172
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:41,019
         - Hi, I'm Earl,
       Norm's twin brother.

173
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:43,007
     - [mimicking explosion]
  - Why's Scully never mentioned

174
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,000
he had a twin before?

175
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,017
    - Because no one talks about
  their siblings with coworkers.

176
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:48,009
- I've told you about
my brother Lawrence.

177
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:49,012
     - Nope, and I don't want to
                 learn about him

178
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:50,019
  and I already forgot his name.

179
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,009
                   Now let's go.
             It's time to heist!

180
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,013
              - No movement yet.
             So here's our plan.

181
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:57,015
After watching everyone coo
over your maudlin proposal,

182
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,013
I've decided we should
employ a similar diversion.

183
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:01,000
         - Smart, I'm in.
       - You will tell Jake

184
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,009
you are pregnant
with his child.

185
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,017
       - What? I'm not pregnant.

186
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,005
- Here is a positive
pregnancy test

187
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:06,013
and a sonogram of your fetus.

188
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,012
Congratulations.
It's a girl.

189
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:10,005
           - Feels a little mean
    to play with Jake's feelings

190
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,013
         like that, sir.
   - You're right, it is mean.

191
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:12,019
Too bad.

192
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,017
As your mentor,
I command you to do it.

193
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:16,014
                    - Wow, okay.

194
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:19,001
               Perhaps we should
     discuss some other options.

195
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:20,010
- There's no time, look.

196
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,001
Peralta's going
for the bracelet!

197
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,018
        - How'd he get him
         free so quickly?

198
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:25,001
     - See ya later, losers!

199
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,010
         - Not so fast!

200
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,000
        [taser crackling]
           - [grunting]

201
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,010
         What the hell was that?

202
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,022
- That Fitbit I gave
you at Christmas?

203
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,014
I modified it into a taser.

204
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:35,012
        - What? Do you even want
           me to get into shape?

205
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,006
-Yeah, but not as
much as I want to win.

206
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,014
Buzz buzz, bitch.

207
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:39,022
       - I've got Scully.
       Come on, let's go.

208
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:42,010
        [taser crackling]
        - [muffled shout]

209
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,016
            No! Nooo!

210
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:48,002
             - Yes.

211
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:49,016
    - Fake heist went perfectly.

212
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,002
- So did the real heist.

213
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,018
- Why is your face
twitching like that?

214
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:55,013
     - Oh, Amy tased me a bunch.
            I bit my own tongue.

215
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,010
     It was awesome. Was it hard
        to get through the door?

216
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,023
- No. I'm strong as hell.

217
00:06:58,023 --> 00:07:00,023
The hard part was getting this
bracelet off Scully's wrist.

218
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:03,017
How can you even feel your
hand with this thing so tight?

219
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,019
        - You're supposed
        to feel your hand?

220
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,009
      - Well, that's terrifying.

221
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,018
            Now if you'll excuse
            me I'm going to hide

222
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:09,011
            the old bracelet and
              win me this heist.

223
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,019
- Don't you mean
win us this heist?

224
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,000
                 - Oh, Terrence,
         unfortunately I do not.

225
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,001
        - What the hell?

226
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,011
         - Sorry, Sarge.

227
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,019
      It had to be this way.
              - Why?

228
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:20,001
      - The banner only has
          my name on it.

229
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:21,010
    It's really all about the
             banner.

230
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,019
          It unfurls by
         a voice command.

231
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:24,011
    But I promise that I will
             mention

232
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,015
     both you and Earl Scully
      in my victory speech.

233
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:27,023
      - Wait, Earl's here?

234
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,001
       - Yeah. He helped us
         with the heist.

235
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:30,015
  - I told that son of a bitch

236
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:32,019
    never to show his face in
         New York again!

237
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,001
      - Why are you running
        towards the glass?

238
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:36,017
        [glass shatters]

239
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:39,008
   - You're a dead man, Earl!

240
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,010
       - That's not great.

241
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,018
   - You're a dead man, Jake!

242
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:42,020
    - Uh, that's much worse.

243
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:47,015
                .

244
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,008
        - Squirt more lube

245
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:48,008
        and help me yank.

246
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,004
         - Ugh, you know
      that fun braggy recap

247
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,012
  we do at the end of each win?

248
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:53,012
   Can we leave this part out?

249
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:54,016
         - [grunts] Yes.

250
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,020
  We'll make up a cooler thing.

251
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,016
           But for now,
        we lube and yank.

252
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:00,003
    Wrap your legs around him
       to anchor yourself.

253
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:01,012
              - Yep. Here we go.

254
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:03,023
      [grunting, screaming]

255
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:05,014
          - Earl? Earl!

256
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:07,020
             - Norm?

257
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,012
              Norm?
           - What the--

258
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:10,016
             - I'm so happy your
          friend invited me to--

259
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,019
- I told you
what would happen

260
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,010
if I ever saw
you again, Earl.

261
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,012
       - What is going on?
      What am I looking at?

262
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:17,010
- Scully has a twin
brother named Earl.

263
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,022
Jake brought him
here to trick you.

264
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:20,013
- Thank you
for the ride, Terrence.

265
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,011
Apparently they don't
get along very well.

266
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,001
- We did get along.
We were inseparable,

267
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,017
until Earl slept
with my wife.

268
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:27,004
  - It's not my fault she wanted

269
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:28,021
         to have sex with a stud
               instead of a dud.

270
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:31,003
- Stud? Your face looks it's
been kicked in by a horse!

271
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:32,017
              - Well, your mouth
          looks like a butthole!

272
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:34,005
- Your whole body
looks like a butthole.

273
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:35,011
    - And you look identical.

274
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:37,001
          - [grunting]

275
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,016
          - [gurgling]

276
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,023
    - Should we help Scully?

277
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:41,003
    - I'm not touching this.

278
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:43,021
           [grunting]

279
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:46,015
- [screams]

280
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:48,005
 - There's nowhere to run, Earl!

281
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,019
        - Well, that was
        a real mind eff.

282
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,013
            Good-bye.
       - Just so you know,

283
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:54,001
Jake has the bracelet
in his pocket.

284
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,013
 - Why would you tell them that?
          We're a team!

285
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,017
- You locked me up.

286
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:58,001
        - Yeah, but they
        didn't know that!

287
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:59,015
           - There's no bracelet
                  in his pocket!

288
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:02,001
    - What? There should be.

289
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,002
         Where'd it go?

290
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:06,002
        - Shalom, partner.
             - Dope.

291
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:07,018
              - And you thought
              Shlomo Ben-Yisrael

292
00:09:07,018 --> 00:09:09,000
          wouldn't come through.

293
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,021
- No, I said the name
and the costume

294
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,022
were offensive,
bordering on actionable.

295
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:15,004
              - Well, it worked.
   Jake brought in Scully's twin

296
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,014
        just like I planned when
   I connected them on Facebook,

297
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,002
              but he had no idea
          they hated each other.

298
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,021
         And when everyone
           was fighting,

299
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:22,022
      they were too distracted
       to notice old Shlomo.

300
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:25,002
     They all underestimated me,
                Rosa, but today,

301
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:28,004
       they will learn the error
       of their ways, for today,

302
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:31,002
        I will prove that nobody
 gets the best of Charles Boyle.

303
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,018
- I doused your beard
in chloroform.

304
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:36,006
           - Really? I find that
             very hard to beli--

305
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:39,006
        [triumphant music]

306
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:44,018
      - Where's this goin'?
    - All the way to Trenton.

307
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,005
         Take your time.

308
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,015
         - Aah, perfect.

309
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,003
          - What? What happened?
 You know where the bracelet is?

310
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:52,003
     - No. Kevin has arrived
       with proof that I am

311
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:53,021
        the only two-time
       winner of the heist.

312
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:55,005
- Here's your cummerbund,
Raymond.

313
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,023
                 - We don't have
             time for this, sir!

314
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,007
       I'm gonna go search
         the first floor.

315
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,023
       - And I will search
        the second floor.

316
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:03,003
We are an inseparable team.

317
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,007
That was a devious fib.

318
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:07,002
I'm betraying her
even as we speak.

319
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:09,015
           - Hey, Kev.
    - Diaz and I are covertly

320
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:12,007
        working together.
 She snuck up through the vents.

321
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,023
This is a major reveal.

322
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:15,021
I feel like you're
not appreciating it.

323
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,015
    - I don't like these heists,
  or what they bring out in you.

324
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,019
      - Oh, clam it, Kevin.
           - "Clam it"?

325
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,019
                Cheddar, perhaps
                we should leave.

326
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,003
      - No, Cheddar stays.

327
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:23,023
           He still has
    an important role to play.

328
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,003
     Give me Mr. Hootsworth.

329
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:29,004
    No one would ever think of
     looking for the bracelet

330
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,004
            in Cheddar's
         favorite chew toy.

331
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:34,003
         - Or do you mean
    Jake's favorite chew toy?

332
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:35,018
           [chuckles]

333
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:39,000
      Well, thank God no one
     was around to hear that.

334
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,020
Ah! There you are.
I've been looking all over.

335
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,002
Woah. That's a lot of yolks.
Are you stress eating again

336
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:45,020
or is this just a
small Terry snack?

337
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,002
      - I'm stress eating, Jake!

338
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:48,007
                  My snack yolks
               are in that bowl.

339
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,023
- Oh. Well,
stop eating eggs

340
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,004
and come help me
with the heist!

341
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,016
      - I'm not helping you.
            - Why not?

342
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:54,004
Ugh, is this because
I once betrayed you?

343
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:56,000
                   - Yes! It was
           our last interaction.

344
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,004
- And it was a huge mistake

345
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,019
and I now realize that
our friendship

346
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,008
is way more important
than any stupid banner.

347
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:03,002
Look, the bracelet
is in Cheddar's chew toy.

348
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,022
I know because I bugged
Holt's cummerbund.

349
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:06,020
            - You did?
    - Yes! I figured he would

350
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,008
bring it in to show off.
Now let's do this!

351
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:10,001
                 - I don't know.

352
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,005
- Look, Sarge,
I'm sorry, okay?

353
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,001
I can't undo the past,
but come on.

354
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:14,017
Would you rather
win the heist with me or sit

355
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:17,001
around swallowing eggs like
Birdo from "Super Mario 2"?

356
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:19,003
       - Birdo doesn't eat eggs.
               Birdo spits them!

357
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:20,021
- Oh, my God, you got
that reference, Terry?

358
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:24,017
We're the perfect team!
Come on, Sarge, please?

359
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,005
        - Fine, I'll help.
         - Ah! Wonderful.

360
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:27,012
But, before you fully commit,

361
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:29,007
I should probably
give you the heads-up.

362
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:31,017
My plan is very elaborate and
you might get a little messy.

363
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:33,021
                       - I'm in.
           It's the heist, baby!

364
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:35,011
             Now let me know how
           we get that chew toy.

365
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:37,001
- All right!
Okay.

366
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,009
First, I infiltrate Holt's
office and continue

367
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:40,007
our argument about
who won last year's heist.

368
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:43,007
      - How many cummerbunds are
    you holding right now? Zero!

369
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:46,003
     It's one bund to none, son!
                Tell him, Kevin.

370
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:47,003
         - I'm leaving.

371
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:48,013
           - It doesn't matter--

372
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,002
     - As Holt argues with me
        I will be covertly

373
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,004
      releasing more water
      into Cheddar's bowl.

374
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,005
Then we sit back
and wait for...

375
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,000
       [Cheddar whimpers]
       - Potty time again?

376
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,010
              - What if he takes
                 him downstairs?

377
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,004
- He won't.
I spent a lot of time

378
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:01,002
making clandestine searches
on Holt's computer.

379
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:04,000
   Now all of his targeted ads
    direct him straight to...

380
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,005
     - The Puppy PeePee Pad.
           Intriguing.

381
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,020
- He bought one
and put it out

382
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,006
on the roof next
to Gina's golden statue.

383
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:11,006
And, because he believes
that Cheddar deserves

384
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:13,009
to pee in privacy like any
other self-respecting adult,

385
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:16,018
   he will leave Cheddar outside
     alone to do his business.

386
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:18,020
  - Notify me when you're done,
            via bark.

387
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,009
  - While Holt guards the door,

388
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:22,022
you'll be swapping out
Mr. Hootsworth for this.

389
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:24,013
        - That all sounds great,

390
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:26,002
  but how do I get onto the roof
          without Holt noticing?

391
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:28,001
- Oh, Sarge.
You'll already be out there...

392
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,022
  In a perfect golden disguise.

393
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,002
  - The plan worked! I got it!

394
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,023
                - Oh my God, you
        look like an Oscar. Ooh!

395
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:37,009
  We should take a picture where
  it looks like I'm holding you.

396
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:38,019
             - Jake.
          -You're right.

397
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,006
                There's no time.
              We'll do it later.

398
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,007
- No, we won't!
Help me get this paint off!

399
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:42,021
  - Okay, put your hands out and

400
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:44,001
I'll squirt you with
a little makeup remover.

401
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:45,002
Hi-ya!

402
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,006
                           - No!

403
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,009
      You're betraying me again?
                            Why?

404
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:50,006
- Because of the banner!

405
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:51,019
    - But I thought you said our
  friendship was more important!

406
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:53,007
- Yeah, that was
obviously a lie.

407
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,011
The banner was very expensive!

408
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:55,011
I don't have
a lot of money, Sarge.

409
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:58,014
All right, bye.

410
00:12:58,014 --> 00:12:59,014
   Don't make a lot of noise.

411
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:04,006
                .

412
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:05,004
        - Howdy. I just got back

413
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,004
        from lunch with Charles,

414
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,002
                who is not here.
                  I am real glad

415
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:09,019
            I skipped the heist.
            Say, who is winning?

416
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:10,023
    - I don't know, but I know
      that I am not winning.

417
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,004
- Interesting,
it is also not me.

418
00:13:13,004 --> 00:13:14,004
      - Uh, why are you guys
         acting so weird?

419
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,023
          - Gah, weird?

420
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:18,000
Would a person who is acting
weird laugh like this?

421
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,012
A huh-huh huh-ha, carefree!

422
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:21,007
             - Yes.
             - Jake!

423
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:23,008
         - Oh, Terry, you ripped
                  yourself free.

424
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:25,003
- Yeah, maybe you
should try cuffing me

425
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,020
to a stronger metal
next time.

426
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,000
        - Yeah, I don't know the
    relative strength of metals.

427
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,007
       - What's going on?

428
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,020
          Why does Terry
       look like an Oscar?

429
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,012
          - Doesn't he?
      - He has the bracelet!

430
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,000
We grabbed Mr. Hootsworth

431
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,011
         from Cheddar and
      swapped it for a fake!

432
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:38,002
- Wow, Terry, my betrayals
were all in good fun,

433
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,008
but this really hurts.

434
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:41,015
                      - Cheddar,
        bring me Mr. Hootsworth.

435
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:45,000
          It's an updated model.

436
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,015
      The bowtie is Turkish blue
      instead of Egyptian blue.

437
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:49,003
              How could you not
              have noticed this?

438
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:51,002
      - Because he's a dog.

439
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:55,007
 And at the end of the day a dog
  is no match for Jake Peralta.

440
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:57,001
   - Well yours is a fake, too.
       Turkish blue bowtie.

441
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,008
- Oh, come on!
The one time

442
00:13:58,008 --> 00:13:59,021
I say out loud
I'm smarter than a dog?

443
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:01,001
        - If I have a fake
       and you have a fake,

444
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:02,015
   who took the real bracelet?

445
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,009
            - I did.
            - Kevin?

446
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,000
  - I swapped out Mr. Hootsworth
            for a fake

447
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,013
      while you were arguing
          with Peralta.

448
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,013
  - How many cummerbunds are you
     holding right now? Zero!

449
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:11,003
   It's one bund to none, son!

450
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,021
- You betrayed me?
But why?

451
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,007
          - I can't have more of
     these trophies in our home.

452
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:16,012
   The cummerbund was already in
                the living room.

453
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:18,005
                    What's next,
        a rusty medical bracelet

454
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:19,021
        suspended above our bed?

455
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:21,011
- Yes! Now hand it over.

456
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,021
              - I don't have it.
              I gave it to Amy.

457
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,009
            - [gasps]
           - Santiago.

458
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,011
    - You betrayed me as well?
     - You betrayed me first.

459
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:28,001
    You were working with Rosa
         this whole time.

460
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,007
- That wasn't real.

461
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:30,021
I was always gonna
stab her in the back.

462
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:32,005
           - You were?
    What kind of person treats

463
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,013
       another human being
            like that?

464
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:35,002
     - You tricked me, Rosa!

465
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,022
       And then you shipped
        me to New Jersey!

466
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:38,012
    - First of all, grow up.
    Second of all, how'd you

467
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,014
     get back here so fast?

468
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:41,002
 - If you get a box wet enough,

469
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:42,002
        it's very easy to
         bust out of it.

470
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:43,012
  - No one ask any follow-ups!

471
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:45,006
       - I knew I couldn't
         trust you, Rosa.

472
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:47,001
    That's why I was going to
   double-cross you with Bill.

473
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:49,002
          That's right,
      he didn't really die.

474
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:51,006
 - Hey, guys, you really thought
   I'd miss this year's heist?

475
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,016
 No way, I'm part of the squad.

476
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,006
              - No.
           - Not true.

477
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:55,013
     - Okay, this is official
      getting hard to track.

478
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,004
    Who has the bracelet now?

479
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,014
- Santiago.

480
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,016
         - Yeah! And none of you
                 are getting it!

481
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,000
- We'll see about that.

482
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,014
        [taser crackling]
            - [groans]

483
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:04,002
                  What the hell?

484
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:05,010
- Remember that very
fancy Swiss pen I got you

485
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,022
for Christmas,
the one that you keep in

486
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:09,010
your pocket at all times?
It's a taser, bro.

487
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,006
            [beeping]
            - Uuugh!

488
00:15:11,006 --> 00:15:13,006
I'll take that. Amy,
do not make me tase you again.

489
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,005
        - No, no, no, no, don't!
                   I'm pregnant!

490
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,002
             - What?
       - I just found out.

491
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:18,015
          It's a girl.
          - Oh, my God!

492
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,014
    - Oh my God, it's happening!

493
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:22,010
  Quick, someone get a reaction
  video of me becoming an uncle!

494
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,023
      - She's making it up.
 The pregnancy scam was my idea.

495
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,015
- No.
No, no, no, no, Amy.

496
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:28,017
Wait, is that true? Did you
just lie to me about our baby?

497
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:30,007
          - Yeah, did you lie to
              us about our baby?

498
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:32,007
         - You tased me!
      - You tased me first!

499
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,014
- Enough!
Terry's had enough of this.

500
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:36,001
This was supposed to be

501
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,007
just a fun game but it's turned
you all into terrible people.

502
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,001
Betraying your husband, putting
your friend in the mail.

503
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:44,014
Jake and Amy, did you guys
buy each other any gifts

504
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:46,007
this year that weren't tasers?

505
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:47,015
              - No.
              - No.

506
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:49,014
- You all pretended that
this was all about

507
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:53,003
helping me with my test.
But none of you cared one bit!

508
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:55,013
You know what?
You all suck!

509
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,003
            [beeping]

510
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:59,004
    - Oh no, my voice command.
         Terry, look out!

511
00:15:59,004 --> 00:16:01,002
           - [groans]

512
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,012
   - Okay. I know that was bad,
      but let's not jump to

513
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:06,000
      any conclusions about
       whose fault it was.

514
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:16,004
           - Wow, what
      a fun improvised song.

515
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:21,016
  - His eyes aren't focusing and
  he hasn't referred to himself

516
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:24,016
 in the third person in minutes.
     He's clearly concussed.

517
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,006
      - Guys, this is bad.

518
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:28,000
      The Lieutenant's exam
        is in 30 minutes.

519
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,007
     - Okay, look, let's just
   get him to One Police Plaza

520
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,016
       and hopefully he'll
       wake up on the way.

521
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,014
  Charles, help me pick him up.
           - Copy that.

522
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:35,016
He's too heavy.
We can't do this.

523
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:37,012
 - God! How does he lift weights
     and also lift his arms?

524
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:39,006
       This is impossible.
    We'll never get him there.

525
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:40,016
       - So you guys need
       help moving a body?

526
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:42,005
       Thank God old Bill's
        part of the squad.

527
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:45,016
        I mean, assuming,
     I am part of the squad.

528
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,019
           - Yes, sure.
            - Totally.

529
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:51,015
       - Oh, yes, finally.
    I have somewhere to live.

530
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:53,009
             - What?
  - Meet me in the alley next to

531
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,013
        my shopping cart.
 It's the one with all the cans.

532
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,001
    - Seems like his plan is

533
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,005
       just to put Terry in
        the shopping cart.

534
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:58,009
            - Correct.
          We'll take it!

535
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,009
     [driving mariachi music]

536
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:06,009
     - Room 410 is this way!

537
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:08,007
    Okay, we got him here with
       one minute to spare.

538
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,001
 - Yes! I knew we could make it.
        All right, Sarge.

539
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,013
           You ready to
 go in there and ace this thing?

540
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,013
   - Yeah, I can't believe it,
      I'm gonna be a pilot!

541
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:15,007
 - Okay, well, that's not great.
   - There's no way he can take

542
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,017
   the test in that condition!

543
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:18,005
       - You're right. Amy,
     you're going to have to

544
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,017
           crawl inside
      his shirt and operate

545
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,005
        his arms for him.
  It's a Ratatouille situation.

546
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,020
             - On it.
  - No. It's over. We have to go

547
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,010
      in there and tell them
   that he won't be making it.

548
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,002
      - So that's it then.

549
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,010
   Rosa, you should probably go
          in first since

550
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,018
    this is mostly your fault.
             - Dude.

551
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:30,009
  - All right, fine, I'll do it,
              jeez.

552
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:36,010
    - Wait. Where is everyone?
     Where are all the desks?

553
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,012
      - What is happening?

554
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:39,010
     What's happening is...

555
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:42,018
          You all suck!
            [beeping]

556
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:55,009
- Son of a bitch stole my song.

557
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,004
                .

558
00:17:59,007 --> 00:17:59,020
 - Wait, Terry has the bracelet?

559
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:04,009
         - That's right.
  Me and my teammate Terry won.

560
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:06,013
       We fooled you all.

561
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:08,019
    - You didn't do [bleep]!
    - Okay, well, neither did

562
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,015
Jordan's teammates,
but they still got rings.

563
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:12,019
All right, fine.
Just tell us how you did it.

564
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:15,010
      - Well, first, for my plan
      to work, it had to happen

565
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,015
           on a day when I could
             control everything.

566
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:18,015
               I couldn't let it
                   be Halloween.

567
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,013
- You faked the gas explosion!

568
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,015
           - Yeah, stupid actors
                 almost blew it.

569
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:24,007
- What was with
that moaning, Trent?

570
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:26,011
I thought you studied at
the Lee Strasberg Institute!

571
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:28,007
     - It doesn't mean anything.
      They just take your money!

572
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,015
- Oh, that is a huge relief.
I felt so bad about poking

573
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,007
that guy's wound to make
sure it was real.

574
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:33,019
              - You should still
            feel bad about that.

575
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:35,005
- No, it was all fake.
I'm totally absolved.

576
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,019
Continue with your story,
Sarge.

577
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,022
  - I knew you'd suggest a heist
           as a distraction from

578
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:41,019
    my Lieutenant exam, then all
        I had to do was sit back

579
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,013
           and watch as everyone
        took things way too far.

580
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:46,012
- But how'd you know we'd
get so out of hand?

581
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:49,012
   - I spent the last six months
   sowing the seeds of conflict.

582
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:51,023
     - Man, I am so sick of Jake
           saying he is the only

583
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,019
              two-time Halloween
                   heist winner.

584
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:56,015
   both: I'm the only two-time
     Halloween heist winner.

585
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:58,000
- I can't believe
everyone says you're

586
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,018
not helpful during
the Halloween heist.

587
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:02,009
Just because they all think
your fingers are too big.

588
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:04,016
       - We'll show them.

589
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:06,015
           - Thanks for inviting
             me over for dinner.

590
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:09,004
      Boy, that's hung in a real
      prominent place, isn't it?

591
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,010
- Not for long.
I was manipulated?

592
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,008
         - Sorry, Kevin.
    - Don't apologize to him,

593
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,012
                          Terry.
           It's his first heist.

594
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:16,008
              He needs to learn.
                     Keep going.

595
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:18,020
    - Well, after I got everyone
  acting like maniacs, all I had

596
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,020
     to do was make you feel bad
       by "knocking myself out."

597
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,008
- The banner.

598
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:24,020
But how did you learn
my voice command?

599
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,021
             - I didn't have to.
      I sold you the damn thing!

600
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:29,015
- No.

601
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:31,012
 I want it to unfurl when I say,
                 "You all suck."

602
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:32,015
[through voice distortion app]
- Absolutely.

603
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:33,019
Pleasure doing
business with you.

604
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:36,005
    - The pleasure was all mine.

605
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,013
             [click]

606
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:38,017
       That's gonna work.

607
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,017
I spent $1,800 on that thing!

608
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:42,021
            - You did?
    - Amy, stop interrupting.

609
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:44,012
Terry's doing his big speech.

610
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:46,017
                  - Anyway, once
          my fake concussion was

611
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:49,013
           on display, I created
         the perfect distraction

612
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:52,007
                  for my partner
                  to do his job.

613
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:56,013
                      - Cheddar,
          you duplicitous bitch.

614
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,009
            - I've been training
            Cheddar for months.

615
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:00,021
- Wow, what a fun
improvised song!

616
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,009
         - When I swapped
         the Hootsworths,

617
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,001
      I put a magnetic collar
              on him!

618
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:06,021
        From there, Cheddar
      followed us all the way

619
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:09,022
        to One Police Plaza,
      where he hand-delivered

620
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:12,010
         the bracelet to me
      right outside this room.

621
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,009
- But, wait, what about
the Lieutenant's exam?

622
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,018
Aren't you supposed to
be taking it right now?

623
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:17,017
               - Hell no, I took
           that thing weeks ago.

624
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:19,018
                   And I passed!
       I'm already a lieutenant!

625
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,008
            - You are?
       - That's incredible!

626
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:22,022
      - Lieutenant Jeffords!
        - This is amazing.

627
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:25,018
  - I'm so proud of you, Terry.

628
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:27,010
- All right.
You've overstepped now, Bill.

629
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,010
              - Yeah, it's weird
              you're here, Bill.

630
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,014
- To Terry Jeffords,
the ultimate human being

631
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:34,008
slash genius.
Nice work...Lieutenant.

632
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:36,018
            all: Yeah!
         - Thanks, squad!

633
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,010
   - Also the next heist will be
                   at Halloween,

634
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,002
      so you'll only be champion
                 for six months.

635
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,010
   This is half a win at best.
   - Sounds about right, yeah.

636
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,022
             - Yeah.
        - Pretty garbage.

637
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:46,002
- Hey, Scully, so you
and Earl made up?

638
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,002
              - Yup.
   Hitchcock helped us realize

639
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:49,018
     we shouldn't fight just
   because we're so different.

640
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:51,018
   - Yeah. To our differences!
           [mugs clink]

641
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:54,021
            [together]
           Oh, dang it!

642
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,003
      [simultaneous farts]

643
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:57,011
            [together]
       Ooh, double dang it.

644
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:59,019
             - What?
          - Oh, my God.

645
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:01,019
           - Terry, what you did
               today was awesome

646
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:04,022
    and I just wanted to say I'm
 sorry if I took things too far.

647
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:06,001
- Are you kidding me?

648
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,009
I was just guilting you
as a tactic.

649
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:08,019
I love how crazy
the heist gets.

650
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:10,017
     - Okay, good, 'cause what I
            really wanted to say

651
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:13,001
   is next heist I'm gonna drown
          you in your own blood.

652
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,014
- Oh, yeah? Well, then I'm
gonna rip your arms off

653
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:15,014
and beat you to
death with 'em.

654
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:17,002
                           - Oh!

655
00:21:17,002 --> 00:21:18,019
- I'm going to slice your
Achilles' tendons, peel off

656
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,011
your fingernails, and stick
knitting needles in your eyes.

657
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,011
         both: Oh, damn.

658
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:22,013
- Raymond, you were right.

659
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:23,019
These heists are fun.

660
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,019
           - Fremulon.

661
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,019
          - Not a doctor.
                Shh.
