1
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:03,316
Another cold brew?

2
00:00:03,352 --> 00:00:05,855
Don't mind if I "cold do." Nailed it.

3
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:07,993
I am loving this machine
that Charles brought in.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,236
It is nice. The trick is to let the
coffee warm up to room temperature.

5
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,325
I'm already on my second cup.

6
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:13,500
This is my third.

7
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:15,763
Stop!

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,331
You're drinking too much!

9
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:20,980
Whoa, what's going on, Charles?
Why are you talking so slow?

10
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:23,423
I'm not. I'm normal.

11
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:26,078
We're all normal.

12
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:32,966
If you're not going slow,
that means we're going fast.

13
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,183
Are we going fast? Can anyone
tell if we're going fast?

14
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,698
I don't think we're going fast
at all in any way whatsoever.

15
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,053
I feel like we're going slow
in every way whatsoever.

16
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:38,385
- Captain, how do you feel?
- Great. Excellent. Amazing.

17
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:39,726
I feel better than
I've ever felt at any moment

18
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:40,771
- in my entire life.
- So we're all fine?

19
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,156
Yep.

20
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:03,776
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

21
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:07,620
Hey there, Captain.
Oh, is this your new assistant?

22
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:08,809
John Urblan. Nice to meet ya.

23
00:01:08,845 --> 00:01:10,536
And John Urblan has just been fired.

24
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:11,555
- What?
- I have?

25
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:13,421
Meet "ya"? You just abbreviated

26
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:14,806
a one-syllable word.

27
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:15,930
- Is this for real?
- Yes.

28
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:17,474
Now clean out your "des."

29
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,914
I removed the K so you'd understand

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,952
how absurd "ya" sound.

31
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:24,381
Oh, boy. Sorry, John Urblan. Bye.

32
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:26,719
Okay, sir, so that is
the third assistant

33
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,191
you've fired in three days.

34
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,142
Because all the candidates are garbage.

35
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:32,528
Microsoft Word is not a special skill,

36
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:34,218
Marcie Lux from South Orange.

37
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:36,387
Come on, look at the size
of that stack of résumés.

38
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:37,903
There's got to be someone good.

39
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,724
Oh, yes, perhaps I should
keep an open mind.

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,502
Perhaps cross-country skiing
is a valuable skill

41
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:45,541
in an office environment,
Marcie Lux of South Orange.

42
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:47,231
Okay, so we can agree
Marcie Lux is out of the mix.

43
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,403
Well, they all are.

44
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,782
I'll just make do with no assistant.

45
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,200
No, don't just give up.

46
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,848
Maybe you haven't found
the right person yet.

47
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:54,665
I found Gina. Maybe I could try.

48
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:56,918
Okay. I suppose it's worth a shot.

49
00:01:56,954 --> 00:01:58,463
I can always fire whoever you choose.

50
00:01:58,499 --> 00:01:59,761
Yeah, that's the spirit.

51
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:02,539
Commence Operation: Nasty.

52
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:05,625
New Assistant Selection Team...

53
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,494
You.

54
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,283
Operation: New Assistant
Selection Team You?

55
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:10,287
Yeah, don't worry about it.

56
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:11,541
Everyone will just call it
Operation: Nasty.

57
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:12,675
You don't have to turn everything

58
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:14,104
into a Thomas Cruise film.

59
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,358
Why not? Movies are super fun.

60
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:16,863
Meanwhile, real life is very boring.

61
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:18,255
That's why no one watches documentaries.

62
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,640
Tell that to the man sitting next to me

63
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:21,243
at last Saturday afternoon's screening

64
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,915
of "Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda."

65
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:25,165
Was that man Kevin?

66
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:27,602
- Yes.
- All right,

67
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:29,118
I'm gonna help you find a new assistant.

68
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,026
Operation: Nasty is a go!

69
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,718
Hey, can I talk to you guys?

70
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:35,191
Ugh, you're not selling
those crapola candy bars

71
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:36,898
for your daughters' doomed
basketball team again, are you?

72
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:37,892
- Doomed?
- Yeah.

73
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:40,029
- They're terrible and you know it.
- Well, I'm not selling candy.

74
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,319
That's next week. Please bring cash.

75
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:44,586
What I want to talk about
is how our office

76
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,909
has turned into a junkyard.

77
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:47,712
Yeah, you know, this place is a mess.

78
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,347
I mean, it's like an episode
of "Hoarders."

79
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:50,541
And not one of the funny ones,

80
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:51,847
where they find a bunch of flat cats.

81
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,806
The problem is, Commissioner Kelly
is never gonna reopen the first floor.

82
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,241
We should just fire
some of the uniforms.

83
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:58,258
But not you. Uh, we couldn't survive

84
00:02:58,294 --> 00:02:59,904
without you, Greg, and...

85
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,117
also Greg?

86
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,148
James and Michael.

87
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:03,707
No one is getting fired.

88
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:05,353
We just need to organize this place.

89
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:07,869
Nah, do what I do. Embrace the mess.

90
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:09,815
You've got a bagel
stuck to your sweater.

91
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,635
Look, I don't want to sound
like a Scully here,

92
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,281
but I think it's hopeless.

93
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:15,169
Nobody could organize this place.

94
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,097
- Nobody?
- Here's what I need.

95
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,902
Sticky notes, three sizes, ten colors.

96
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:20,418
Permanent markers, clickable only.

97
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:21,673
I don't want caps slowing us down.

98
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,494
And I need garbage bags, 33 gallon,

99
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,602
blackout, cinch top.

100
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,161
What are you all still doing here?

101
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:27,529
Go, go, go!

102
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,645
Captain Holt,

103
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,284
I'd like to introduce you
to your new assistant.

104
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,499
Drumroll, please.

105
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,080
- That's your drumroll?
- When a tempo isn't specified,

106
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,031
any reasonable person
would default to lento.

107
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,107
Well, it's terrible,
and you ruined a fun thing,

108
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:45,830
but I would still like to introduce you

109
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,681
to Mr. Gordon Lundt!

110
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,982
Mr. Gordon Lundt!

111
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:53,844
Gordon, you want to come in here?

112
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,106
Oh, I'm so sorry.

113
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:57,137
I was just deciding whether
I should just go home.

114
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:59,044
The tone and tenor of your introduction

115
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,046
make me worry that this is
a "fun" office,

116
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,657
which I would not enjoy.

117
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,679
Ehh?

118
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,282
Hello, I'm Captain Raymond Holt,

119
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,885
and I can assure you,
this is not a fun office.

120
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:09,240
Thank goodness.

121
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:11,804
In that case, my interest is renewed.

122
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,175
- Here is my résumé.
- Oh, I'm feeling this.

123
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:15,690
Are you guys feeling this?
Gordon, why don't you

124
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:17,336
tell Captain Holt
a little bit about yourself?

125
00:04:17,372 --> 00:04:19,635
Where to begin?
I'm 174 centimeters tall,

126
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:21,456
I can type 103 words per minute

127
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,903
with an error rate of 1.6%,

128
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,708
and I recently moved here
from Philadelphia,

129
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,753
which is the sixth
most populous U.S. city.

130
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,095
I understand the city of Philadelphia

131
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:31,046
is coterminous with Philadelphia County,

132
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:34,174
making it the eighth-largest
metropolitan statistical area.

133
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,168
Yeah, Philly's cool. Isn't it fun

134
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,954
- just telling each other facts?
- Yes.

135
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,911
Well, I think I have
all the information I need.

136
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:40,956
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Lundt.

137
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:41,819
My pleasure.

138
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,940
So...

139
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:46,442
looks like Operation: Nasty
is a full-on success, huh?

140
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:48,999
You mean Operation: Nasty Sex Slut.

141
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:51,034
Didn't you see him flirting with me?

142
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,375
No, I most definitely did not.

143
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:54,217
Then you're a blind man
and a prude to boot.

144
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,689
Did you see his tie? A single Windsor.

145
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:57,745
The easiest knot to undo.

146
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,064
Why bother wearing any clothes at all?

147
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,926
I think you badly misread
that interaction.

148
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:03,573
Please. He did everything
but lick his lips and purr.

149
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:04,782
Get rid of him, and bring me someone

150
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:06,559
who can keep it in their slacks.

151
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:08,031
Did someone say to take off our slacks?

152
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,574
No, not even close.

153
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,134
Oh. Well, keep me posted.

154
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,280
My dogs are barkin'.

155
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:15,131
What dogs?

156
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,123
Okay, Marie Kondo came up with a system

157
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,474
to unclutter your life.
You look at an object,

158
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:21,729
and if it doesn't bring you joy,

159
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:23,401
you throw it away. Try it, Sarge.

160
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,174
Hello, backup pair of suspenders.

161
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:26,347
Do you bring me joy?

162
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:28,419
Yes, because you have tab endings

163
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:29,760
and a sweet leather yoke.

164
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,278
I'm so glad you're in my life.

165
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,171
- I guess I'm keeping 'em.
- Ooh, let me try.

166
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,512
Hello, bag of old dried mushrooms.

167
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,637
Do you bring me joy? Yes!

168
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:41,329
You provide rich, earthy flavor
to both soups and teas.

169
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:43,280
I guess I'm keeping mine too.
This is fun.

170
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:44,491
Guys, you can't keep everything.

171
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:45,963
That defeats the purpose.

172
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:48,426
I got this, Ames. Hello, unsolved case.

173
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:49,663
Do you bring me joy?

174
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:52,002
No, because you're boring
and you're too hard. See ya.

175
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,461
Personal items only, Scully.

176
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:55,933
Get that case out of the trash.

177
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,665
Oh, for Pete's sake.

178
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,557
Sir, we need to talk about Gordon Lundt,

179
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:01,705
and before you ask,

180
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,283
- I have not fired him.
- Yes, I noticed.

181
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,364
He's been strutting around
like a peacock,

182
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,315
trying desperately to arouse me,

183
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:09,310
his unwilling peahen.

184
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,184
Did you hear
there's a barrel-making exhibit

185
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,539
at the Brooklyn Museum of Industry?

186
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:13,558
Yes.

187
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:17,501
Has he no shame? The door was open.

188
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:18,887
I think he wanted people to hear.

189
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:20,185
Yeah, well, I didn't fire him

190
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,535
because I thought you were being crazy

191
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:22,884
and I wanted to change your mind,

192
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,572
so I called all the places
he used to work.

193
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,112
You didn't do that
before you brought him in?

194
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:27,671
What? No, you check references

195
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:29,319
after there's a problem.
That's hiring 101.

196
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,706
Anyways, it turns out he never
worked at the Philadelphia PD.

197
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:35,745
So he's a liar and a hussy?
Why is he still here?

198
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,479
Because I started thinking,
why would he lie?

199
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:39,922
And the answer is:

200
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:42,567
because he's a spy, planted here

201
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,169
by Commissioner Kelly. Think about it.

202
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,250
You've been rounding up all
the captains who oppose him.

203
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,847
Kelly wants those names.

204
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,841
Gordon was sent here to seduce you.

205
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:51,808
- He's a red sparrow.
- You mean a honeypot.

206
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,628
Potato, tomato, but yes.

207
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,801
He is the world's most boring sex spy,

208
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,006
and he's here to infiltrate
the Nine-Nine.

209
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,190
No, this is just you

210
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,843
still trying to make
everything into a movie.

211
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,620
This is the real world, Peralta.

212
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,291
There are no spies in our midst.

213
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,721
I'm sure Gordon just lied
on his résumé to get a job.

214
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:09,957
Oh, really? Then how come
he's in this old staff photo

215
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:11,804
from the Three-Six?

216
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,015
Kelly's old precinct?

217
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,493
You're right. Gordon's a honeypot.

218
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:16,582
Or a red sparrow.

219
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:18,272
Buzz, buzz, little bee.

220
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:19,550
Fly, bird, fly.

221
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:20,761
- Buzz.
- Fly.

222
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:21,841
- Buzz.
- Fly.

223
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:24,488
- Buzz.
- Fly.

224
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,948
The point is, we're on
the same page. He's a spy.

225
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:30,242
Hey, Hitchcock.

226
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,057
God, you scared me. I've got a razor.

227
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:33,345
Sorry. I need the bathroom.

228
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,061
Fine, but you're lucky
I didn't cut myself.

229
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:36,925
Yep, sure am.

230
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,615
Have a good one, buddy.

231
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,181
- Any poopers?
- None.

232
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:42,792
What is this? Why are we
meeting in the bathroom?

233
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,343
Super cool meeting spot.

234
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,512
Don't roll your eyes at me, Daria.

235
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:48,420
Commissioner Kelly sent a spy
into our midst.

236
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:50,415
This is happening.
We need to talk about our plan.

237
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,595
Okay, here it is. I'm going to fire him.

238
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:53,904
You can't do that.

239
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,515
In a movie, when you find out
someone's a spy, you don't fire them.

240
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:57,944
You can either have them murdered...

241
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,851
- Not an option.
- Yeah, I know, we're cops.

242
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,490
Blah, blah.
No one likes this side of you.

243
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:03,294
Or we can launch
a counter-spying mission.

244
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,027
I just want him out of the Nine-Nine.

245
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:06,978
If we can prove that Kelly sent a spy

246
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:09,234
into one of his own precincts
to seduce a captain,

247
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,011
it's gonna look really bad for him.

248
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:13,124
- And how will we prove that?
- With Operation: Dragon.

249
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:16,230
Don't Reveal Anything,
Gordon's Our Nemesis.

250
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:18,987
- No.
- I worked so hard on that acronym.

251
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:21,098
You're not even going to acknowledge it?
All right, look,

252
00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:22,360
if Kelly's been communicating
with Gordon,

253
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:23,705
there has to be evidence on his laptop.

254
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:25,525
Yeah, but he doesn't leave
his computer unattended.

255
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:27,895
It's always in his bag, which
he always has on his person.

256
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,063
How do you know that?

257
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:30,238
I've glanced at his work satchel.

258
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:32,109
I'm married, but I'm still a man.

259
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,885
Choosing to ignore that.
Now, if there were only

260
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:36,170
some place where they make you
check your bag,

261
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:39,560
like an airport, or even a museum?

262
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,465
No. I couldn't.

263
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:42,589
Couldn't you?

264
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,121
Mr. Lundt, would you like to go

265
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:45,473
to the barrel-making exhibit
this evening?

266
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,516
Yes, Captain Holt.
I could make time for that.

267
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,541
I need a shower.

268
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,871
Okay, I went through my desk
and got rid of everything

269
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:56,002
that didn't give me joy.

270
00:08:56,046 --> 00:08:57,134
You didn't get rid of anything.

271
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,279
Because it all gives me joy.

272
00:08:58,315 --> 00:08:59,800
Picture of Nikolaj, joy.

273
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:02,633
Cocktail napkin from my
first date with Genevieve, joy.

274
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:05,069
Birthday card from my urologist, joy.

275
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:06,759
He was the only doctor of my entire

276
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:08,449
urethral support staff who remembered.

277
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:11,053
All right, I don't think
Marie Kondo's gonna work here.

278
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:12,655
We need something stronger.

279
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:16,048
The Norwegian system: Munkensmat.

280
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,694
It was designed by a radical group

281
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,123
of Scandinavian organizers

282
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,508
who are doing things with cubbies

283
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:22,659
that would blow your minds.

284
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,106
We need to Munkensmat.

285
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:25,729
- "Munkensmat"?
- Sexy, right?

286
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,927
In Munkensmat, you get rid
of all personal possessions

287
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:31,032
- except one.
- I can't do that.

288
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:32,504
What, I'm just supposed to get rid

289
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,183
of my great-grandfather's shoes?

290
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,798
He had one baby foot. This is cruel.

291
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:39,645
Munkensmat isn't cruel. It's freeing.

292
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:42,554
When you cling to these things,
you cling to the past,

293
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,968
and you don't leave room
for new experiences.

294
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:46,724
Okay, what one thing should I keep?

295
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:48,678
Hatchet or Blu-ray of "The Intern"?

296
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:49,977
You can always watch
"The Intern" online.

297
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:51,319
Not the extras.

298
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:52,972
There's a virtual tour
of Jules's kitchen.

299
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:54,074
Monster.

300
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,851
Well, Sarge, what's it gonna be,

301
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,715
pictures of your kids
or those suspenders?

302
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,579
Terry can't throw his family away,

303
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:02,227
but these are nice suspenders.

304
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:03,830
Are they special in some kind of way?

305
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:05,825
Damn, Amy, I told you
about the leather yoke!

306
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:07,778
Terry, you're clinging.

307
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,570
- Munkensmat.
- My turn.

308
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:11,912
It's between my seizure medication

309
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:13,461
and this fidget spinner.

310
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:15,704
I think I made the right call.

311
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,596
Uh-oh. I forgot that it lit up.

312
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,997
I've made a terrible mistake.

313
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:23,264
_

314
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:24,631
Look at that.

315
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,484
They put the sherry barrels
right up front.

316
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:29,157
Ugh. I hate it when museums
pander to the tourists.

317
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,097
Oh, I think you need to check
your bag, Gordon.

318
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,257
It's a small price to pay to make
sure the barrels are protected.

319
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:34,679
My thoughts exactly.

320
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:37,278
- The package is headed your way.
- Copy that.

321
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,455
This better work.
I'm debasing myself out here.

322
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:42,326
- What must people think?
- Relax.

323
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,591
There's literally
no other people at this museum.

324
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,338
Thank you very much. Here is $100.
Pleasure doing business with you.

325
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:50,767
You know, you could have
just stolen the bag,

326
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:51,804
and wouldn't have noticed or cared.

327
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,581
Ugh. Be better, Yanya.

328
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:55,192
- Okay.
- Yanya!

329
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:59,125
Okay, sir, I am cloning the hard drive.

330
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:00,910
You should only
have to distract him for...

331
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,129
three hours? Good Lord.

332
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,088
Do you think that you can talk
about barrels for three hours?

333
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,205
Watch me.

334
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,224
Ah, Gordon, take a gander
at this brine barrel from 1787.

335
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:11,747
It looks to me like the work

336
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,603
of master hooper Josiah Wooldruff,

337
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,360
who learned the craft from
his father Jesiah Wooldruff,

338
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:17,883
who in turn learned it from his.

339
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,363
I'm already so bored.

340
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:21,496
The slats are not flat. They're curved.

341
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,324
The base of the barrel
is approximately 20...

342
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,456
Every barrel is inspected before usage.

343
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,721
The key is that the oak
was cured and shaped

344
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,628
by Josiah's cousin Joshua,

345
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:31,709
who was a cooper and not a hooper.

346
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,660
Wait, are you still at the same barrel?

347
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,133
Please move on to another one.

348
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,736
There are so many barrels in there.

349
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,925
You know what?
Let's look at that barrel.

350
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,094
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a brine barrel as well.

351
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,870
It was also made in the 1780s.

352
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,256
In fact, it's identical
to the last barrel.

353
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,076
Let's review why that's interesting.

354
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:49,592
No!

355
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,673
Having each selected our one item,

356
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,798
we move on to stage two, cleansing.

357
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,532
In Munkensmat, you don't just throw away

358
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:56,743
your discarded belongings.

359
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,323
- You incinerate them.
- What?

360
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,838
Can't we just donate this stuff?

361
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:01,258
So you can go to Goodwill after work

362
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:03,356
and buy back those suspenders
you're so attached to?

363
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:06,349
- No.
- Now, in true Munkensmat,

364
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:08,499
you pile all of your belongings
on a raft,

365
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:10,108
push it out to the icy sea,

366
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,276
and set fire to it with a flaming arrow.

367
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:14,419
But since we obviously
don't have an archer...

368
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,552
I'm an archer.
I have like six bows in my car.

369
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:17,628
Really?

370
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:21,813
Launch.

371
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,720
Oh, Munkensmat.

372
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:28,844
Munkensmat.

373
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,534
Munkensmat!

374
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:33,528
Have you reviewed the
contents of Gordon's computer?

375
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:34,652
Did you find anything?

376
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:37,604
Uh, well, hem, haw...

377
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,262
Are you literally saying
"hem" and "haw"?

378
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:41,038
Look, I haven't found anything, okay?

379
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,381
Not a single email
between Kelly and Gordon.

380
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,941
So I whored myself out
at that museum for nothing.

381
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:48,197
Not entirely for nothing.
You know? We had fun.

382
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:50,714
Sneaking around, bribing
people, lying, stealing stuff.

383
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,099
Coming home and having my husband ask me

384
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:53,441
why I smelled like barrels?

385
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:54,957
Seriously? What did you say?

386
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,212
I told him everything. He understood,

387
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:58,206
until I showed him a picture of Gordon.

388
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:01,656
The thought of me at a museum
with that ten?

389
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:03,293
He banished me to the guest room.

390
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:04,599
Captain Holt, are you in there?

391
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:06,252
Oh, no, it's him. What does he want?

392
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:07,253
Do you think he knows something happened

393
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:08,603
at the Barrel Museum?

394
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,078
I wanted to talk to you about something

395
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:11,202
that happened at the Barrel Museum.

396
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,770
I think he knows. This is bad!

397
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:15,010
Well, the longer we talk,
the more suspicious it seems.

398
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,750
- Tell him to come in.
- Come in!

399
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:21,529
Oh. I prefer to discuss
this matter in private.

400
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:23,052
Anything you have to say
to me, you can say

401
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,184
- in front of Peralta.
- Very well.

402
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:25,722
I've been sent here to spy on you.

403
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:28,238
What? I am truly shocked.

404
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,667
We are both shocked.

405
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,147
Commissioner Kelly
knows you're recruiting

406
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,496
a team of captains to oppose him.

407
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,949
He asked me to find out who they are.

408
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,078
But I've decided I won't help him.

409
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:37,551
- Why not?
- Because...

410
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,062
I've fallen in love with you.

411
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,757
What?

412
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:42,882
That is truly shocking.

413
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:44,394
For real this time. What?

414
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,830
The plan was for me to
weaken your defenses

415
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,130
with my brazen sexuality.

416
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,472
I wouldn't say "brazen"

417
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:50,945
so much as "completely undetectable."

418
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:52,268
I couldn't have been more obvious.

419
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,019
I wore a single Windsor knot.

420
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:55,535
I might as well have a sign
around my neck

421
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:56,877
that reads "DTF."

422
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:58,487
"Desiring Thorough Fornication."

423
00:13:58,523 --> 00:13:59,483
- Nope.
- Exactly.

424
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,520
- Oh.
- At first, the flirting

425
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:01,700
was just part of the ruse.

426
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:02,745
It meant nothing to me.

427
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:04,433
But then the Barrel Museum.

428
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,183
- I fell hard.
- Not surprising.

429
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:07,967
It is an erotically charged atmosphere.

430
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:09,224
The curve of the slats,

431
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,175
the rivets, the bilge, the bunghole.

432
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:13,108
Okay, I am actually starting
to hear the sex talk now.

433
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,537
The bunghole is the least
erotic part of the barrel.

434
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:16,009
- It's simply functional.
- Sure.

435
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,430
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Bunghole. Continue.

436
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:19,294
Captain, I know nothing
could ever happen between us,

437
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,785
but I care about you too much
to do Kelly's dirty work,

438
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,344
which is why I'm tendering
my resignation.

439
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,772
That's very honorable. I accept.

440
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:27,027
Oh, no, you don't.
This could be our chance.

441
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:29,674
We can turn Kelly's agent
into a double agent.

442
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,494
Operation: Double Dragon.

443
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,009
Oh, it's all starting to happen.

444
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,874
I don't want to play
these movie spy games, Peralta.

445
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,284
- It could backfire.
- Or it could front-fire.

446
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,165
- What?
- It worked.

447
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:40,760
Gordon, do you have any hard proof

448
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,320
- that Kelly sent you here?
- Nothing in writing.

449
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,531
We only communicate in person.

450
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,003
Okay, so you call Kelly,

451
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,824
arrange for a meeting,
then you wear a wire,

452
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,645
and we have tape of the commissioner

453
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,191
admitting that he's spying
on one of his captains.

454
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:52,657
It could work, but I could never
put Gordon in that position.

455
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:53,998
I would do anything for you,
Captain Holt.

456
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:56,074
Thank you. And you can call me Raymond.

457
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:57,689
Captain Raymond Holt.

458
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,184
I don't think that's such a good idea.

459
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,612
You're right, too much.

460
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,860
That should never have happened.

461
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,500
- Agreed.
- Wait, what?

462
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,716
Did something just happen?
I've been standing here the whole time.

463
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:06,939
What did I miss?

464
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,634
What did I miss?

465
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:10,595
What did I miss?

466
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,032
Hey, can I take
a couple photos of your desk?

467
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:15,078
I want to submit them
to "Organizers Quarterly."

468
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:16,166
- What?
- There's a magazine

469
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,630
- about organizing?
- Yeah.

470
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,668
I want to be featured
as Organizer of the Month.

471
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,271
Just imagine, me on the cover

472
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:23,554
with tons of scarves lying around.

473
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,113
I'm holding them up like,

474
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,002
"This is too many scarves.
We got to do something!"

475
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:29,494
Okay.

476
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:32,878
Ooh, now can you open the drawers?

477
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,271
If you want to get featured,
you got to show them

478
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:35,751
what's under the skirt,
know what I mean?

479
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:38,144
Uh, no, there are case files in here.

480
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,277
I don't want any sensitive info
to get out.

481
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,713
I'll blur the personal stuff.

482
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,756
Come on, this is the money shot.

483
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,023
Seriously, Terry?

484
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,894
You didn't throw out the suspenders?

485
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,804
What? That's not fair.

486
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:53,246
I had to throw out Great
Grandpa Ellen's bitty shoe!

487
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,161
Why are you even holding on to these?

488
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,076
- I've never seen you wear them.
- I haven't.

489
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,601
I saw them at the store, and
they're obviously way better

490
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:00,682
than my normal suspenders.

491
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:02,372
- Are they?
- Yeah!

492
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:03,974
Tab endings, leather yoke.

493
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,490
I can't keep describing them.

494
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:07,991
- All right, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

495
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:10,529
I bought them right before
I took the lieutenant's exam.

496
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,143
I was gonna wear them on
my first day as a lieutenant,

497
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,920
but then I failed the test.

498
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:17,575
I thought I'd keep them
just in case I ever pass it,

499
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:19,978
but I'll be honest.

500
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:21,782
That's never gonna happen.

501
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:24,415
I'll just throw them out.

502
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:27,031
There. You can take your photo now.

503
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:34,175
The deadline's tomorrow.

504
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:36,639
We're just listening from afar.

505
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:37,981
Do we really need to be in disguise?

506
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,802
Yes, Carmine. Yes, we do.

507
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:42,798
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Your cover is Carmine Frunch.

508
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,575
You have emphysema, and your
best friend is your pet bird.

509
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:46,177
I'm not sure I like this persona.

510
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,910
Well, if you make it
too cool, it's not believable.

511
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:49,861
By the way, my name is Jackson Fox.

512
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:51,116
I'm an NBA player,

513
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:52,589
and LeBron James is my best friend.

514
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,788
Oh, here comes Kelly.

515
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:56,184
So, Mr. Lundt. Good to see you.

516
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,704
What's all this about?

517
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,138
Captain Holt and the Nine-Nine.

518
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:00,693
That's it, Gordon. Lure him in.

519
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,514
He's plotting against you
with a group of captains.

520
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,510
I'm only here because he asked
me to help him entrap you.

521
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,766
- What is happening?
- He's triple-crossing us.

522
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:09,848
Holt is listening in
from that surveillance vehicle.

523
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:11,625
Hey, Gordon, can you still hear me?

524
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,054
- Yes.
- You are blowing this, man!

525
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,876
Oh, hi, Raymond. Good to see you.

526
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,566
- Pull up a chair.
- Cut the crap.

527
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:22,602
Stop masking your evil
with a candy cane smile.

528
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:24,248
Ooh, I love candy canes.

529
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,938
Everyone loves candy canes, John Kelly.

530
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,410
Now admit you sent in
this boring bastard

531
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,752
to honeypot Holt.

532
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:30,007
It feels like you two are the spies

533
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:32,219
based on your disguises, et cetera.

534
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:34,431
Nuh-uh. This is who we actually are.

535
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:35,994
A professional basketball player

536
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,858
and a guy with a bird friend.

537
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:39,852
Oh, it's not just about disguises.

538
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:42,542
Everything that you recorded
on your wire

539
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:46,147
clearly indicates that
I was the one being spied on.

540
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,691
- Ow.
- Case closed.

541
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:48,831
Pretty cool, huh?

542
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,520
I can't wait to play that tape
for the mayor.

543
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:52,332
You are gonna look so bad, Raymond.

544
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:53,326
You're never gonna get
away with this, Kelly.

545
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,562
Oh, I already have.

546
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:56,034
Worked out better than I expected.

547
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,463
I just sent Lundt in
to find out which captains

548
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,631
you'd rallied against me,
and then you decided

549
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:04,105
you wanted to bug
the commissioner of the NYPD.

550
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:06,534
Somebody shot themselves in the foot.

551
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,916
Hey, do me a favor.

552
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,389
Put your resignation on my desk
in the morning.

553
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:11,862
I'm so sorry, sir. This is all my fault.

554
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:13,683
Operation: Double Dragon was a debacle.

555
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,547
Yes, it was.

556
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,283
If only someone had thought
to plan a backup operation.

557
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,780
- Did you do something cool?
- I did something very cool.

558
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:23,470
While I was banished to the guest room,

559
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:25,116
I flipped across one
of those Thomas Cruise films

560
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:27,821
on Home Box Office,
and I realized something.

561
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,730
On a spy mission,
there's always another twist.

562
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:33,286
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I knew

563
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,237
you would triple-cross our double-cross,

564
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,066
so I planted a microphone
in the napkin holder.

565
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,370
There's one in the flowerpot.

566
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:41,451
Ketchup, mustard.
There are mics in both.

567
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,010
- Where?
- In the tips.

568
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:45,024
Oh, this is so great.
Where else are there mics?

569
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,105
- Nowhere.
- Oh.

570
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:48,839
But there are cameras!

571
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,833
There's a camera, there's a camera,

572
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,479
and there's a camera.

573
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:54,307
I've got you on tape, Kelly.
You're screwed.

574
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,302
The only thing that's gonna be
on your desk in the morning

575
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:57,807
is a list of my demands.

576
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,801
Operation: Triple Dragon is complete.

577
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:02,317
- You named it.
- Not only did I name it,

578
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:04,659
Triple Dragon is an acronym.

579
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,133
Two Righteous Individuals

580
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,278
Performing Law Enforcement
Directives Rapidly

581
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,751
Against Gordon Our Nemesis.
Triple Dragon!

582
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:12,317
This is the best thing
that's ever happened!

583
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:15,337
I mean, not for you, obviously.

584
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,805
It's bad for you.

585
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,756
What is all this junk on my desk?

586
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,700
It's not very Munkensmat.

587
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,894
They're study materials
for the lieutenant's exam.

588
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,018
You can't give up.

589
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:26,114
You're gonna take the exam again,

590
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:27,246
you're gonna ace it,

591
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,943
and then you're gonna wear these.

592
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,205
My lieutenant suspenders.

593
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:31,490
You fished them out of the trash.

594
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:33,571
No, they were covered in precinct goo,

595
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:34,782
but I got you a new pair,

596
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:36,366
- leather yoke and all.
- Aw.

597
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:37,877
Some things are worth clinging to.

598
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:38,870
I was wrong.

599
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:40,081
Or Niles Bunkampf,

600
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:42,163
the inventor of Munkensmat, was wrong.

601
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,389
- Yeah, that guy's an idiot.
- Was an idiot.

602
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,135
He got rid of all his objects,
including his clothes,

603
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:48,354
and froze to death in a snowdrift.

604
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:49,833
Why didn't you tell us that

605
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:50,986
before we burned all our treasures?

606
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:53,141
Eight framed photos of my dad,
up in flames.

607
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:54,708
So does this mean we can start

608
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,013
keeping personal objects
in the office again?

609
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,916
Yes, on one condition.

610
00:19:57,952 --> 00:19:59,997
No one tells Bruce
from "Organizers Quarterly."

611
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm definitely not gonna
reach out to Bruce.

612
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,420
Oh, thank you.

613
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:05,674
You're a good friend.

614
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,010
_

615
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,332
Ah, good morning, Captain Holt.

616
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,529
You're looking refreshed.

617
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,480
Interesting. I didn't sleep a wink.

618
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:16,562
Let's just say Kevin no longer
has me in the guest room.

619
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:20,350
Nice. My two dads, straight smashin' it.

620
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,910
Sorry, that came out weird.
Title of your sex tape.

621
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:24,868
But more importantly, how did
it go with Commissioner Kelly?

622
00:20:24,912 --> 00:20:26,435
I gave him a list of my demands,

623
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,622
and he's agreed to back off
of vigilant policing.

624
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:30,573
- Whoa, that's amazing.
- But that's not all.

625
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:32,308
I also got something for the precinct.

626
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,330
Is it a fighter jet?
How did you get a fighter jet?

627
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,690
We don't have the budget for that.

628
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:37,032
- It's not a fighter jet.
- Aw.

629
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:39,113
I got him to reopen the first floor.

630
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:43,707
It's back to normal.

631
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,294
It's beautiful.

632
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,781
Thank you, sir.

633
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,336
I couldn't have done it without you.

634
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,372
As a matter of fact, I'd like
to take you out tonight

635
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,373
for a thank-you dinner.

636
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,713
Oh, I would love that,

637
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,376
but I'm gonna have to take a rain check,

638
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,986
'cause Amy and I already have plans.

639
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,308
Although I'm pretty sure
you would approve.

640
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:00,607
So this is a brine barrel.

641
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:02,079
It's made by Josiah Wooldruff,

642
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:05,248
who learned the craft from
his father Jesiah Wooldruff,

643
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:06,894
who in turn learned... you know what?

644
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,061
This was a terrible idea. I'm sorry.

645
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:09,881
- Don't you dare stop.
- Oh.

646
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,048
Okay.

647
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:13,651
Josiah's cousin Joshua was a cooper,

648
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:14,775
not a hooper.

649
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:16,117
Oh, mama.

650
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,583
