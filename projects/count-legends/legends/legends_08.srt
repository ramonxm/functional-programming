1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:01,994
And now on to new business.

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,717
Peralta. There's a case
I'd like you to handle.

3
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,257
Methodist Hospital called this morning.

4
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,607
Apparently, a 38-year-old
investment banker

5
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:09,475
was admitted last night
with a broken penis.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,110
- It looks like...
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

7
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,198
There's a finance guy
with a broken dong?

8
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,629
Uh, methinks some
"Wolf of Wall Street" style

9
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:18,233
shenana-googles have
taken place this day.

10
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,025
Anyone care to wager a guess
as to how this happened?

11
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,596
Yeah, I bet he dipped it
in a pile of cocaine,

12
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:23,661
got it real numb, and then hit
a croquet ball with it.

13
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:25,241
- Totally possible.
- He probably sat on it.

14
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:26,989
- So it got under his butt.
- Happens all the time.

15
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:28,611
- Sure do.
- Ugh, you guys are horrible.

16
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:30,613
And you're wrong
because he was clearly driving

17
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:32,381
his Bentley naked,
tried to pee out the window,

18
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:36,234
and was then struck
by a goose on the wang.

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,164
Is that what happened, sir?
Was he struck by a goose?

20
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,671
He was actually struck
by a female coworker

21
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,440
who claims he attempted
to sexually assault her.

22
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,375
- [all groan]
- I really wish you had

23
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,725
stopped us before we started guessing.

24
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,923
I'm not responsible for that.

25
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,496
Now due to the sensitive subject matter,

26
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:49,131
I think it makes sense
to partner Peralta with...

27
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,030
Me? Because I'm the best at sex?

28
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:52,771
No, Hitchcock. In fact, you know what?

29
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,703
This isn't your week.
Why don't you take a few days off?

30
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:55,832
Sweet!

31
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:58,473
- Have fun working, cucks!
- What?

32
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:00,441
Captain, I'd like to work
the case with Jake.

33
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,536
I have the time.

34
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:02,770
I'm three weeks ahead on my paperwork.

35
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:04,813
Fine. Santiago and Peralta,
talk to both parties.

36
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,581
Get to the bottom of this broken penis.

37
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:09,517
Wait. I just want
to say I think it's sad

38
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:11,818
that we as a society can
no longer laugh at the phrase

39
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:14,033
"broken penis," and it is my dream

40
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,658
that we one day shall again.
Team Broken Penis on three.

41
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:19,494
- One, two, three...
- Broken penis!

42
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,768
Yeah, probably should've
seen that coming.

43
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,965

Oh, you can stand

48
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,058
No, it's cool.

49
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:51,993
The doctor said I need
to change positions

50
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,728
frequently so I don't form
a penile clot.

Oh, I'm not gonna barf, so on that note,

please explain the events
that led to your diaper.

53
00:01:58,562 --> 00:01:59,995
So last night I was giving my coworker,

54
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,401
Keri, some pointers on her trades.

55
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:03,371
Told her "lever up on VTC.

56
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,173
There's no fat tail
on the vol's wicked low."

57
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,307
I just didn't want her to chump it.

58
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:09,043
Right, and you spoke that way
because you were...

59
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,611
- snowboarding?
- No, we were in my office.

60
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,180
- Yeah.
- Anyway, she just flipped out

61
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,448
and hit me with my favorite golf club.

62
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,216
Ms. Brennan is claiming she attacked you

63
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,218
in self-defense after you
sexually assaulted her.

64
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,020
[chuckles] Yeah, because she's crazy.

65
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,089
I know we're not supposed
to say that about women.

66
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,291
I usually wouldn't go there
because I'm a huge advocate.

67
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,426
I mean, I'm the kind of guy
who thinks Kathryn Bigelow

68
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,794
should direct the next "Star Wars."

69
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,197
I've said that out loud to other men.

70
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,798
Thank you, Mr. Haggerty.
We'll be in touch.

71
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,769
Great, thanks. [unevenly]
I'm gonna stand up now.

72
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,437
[gradually bellows]

73
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:38,873
- [knocks]
- Captain, sorry to interrupt.

74
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,309
I just got off the phone with
the Department of Corrections.

75
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:44,496
They wanted me to let you know
that Ernest Zumowski died.

76
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:46,094
My goodness.

77
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,443
It's been a while
since I've heard that name.

78
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,884
I hunted him for years

79
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,788
and finally caught him and put
an end to his bloodlust.

80
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:58,326
In some sick way, I am who I am
because of Ernest Zumowski

81
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,862
- AKA...
- ALL: The Disco Strangler.

82
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:02,663
Oh, so you knew who I was talking about?

83
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:04,232
Yeah, sir, you talk about him a lot.

84
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,367
- You know, the yo-yo was his...
- ALL: Calling card.

85
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,669
Oh, I mentioned that too?
So how'd he die?

86
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:10,271
He was in a prison transport van,

87
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:11,839
and he got in a terrible accident.

88
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:13,741
It burst into flames,
and he was trapped inside.

89
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,199
[laughing]

90
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:18,718
Well, well, well, he finally did it.

91
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:21,144
- Died horribly?
- Escaped.

92
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,684
Just like he said he would
all those years ago.

93
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,286
I'll be coming back for you.

94
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:28,789
I'm just like disco, baby.
I will never die.

95
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:32,226
True, disco will never die,
but you will...

96
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,195
ALL: In your cell, punk.

97
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,764
Oh, so I've told that part
of the story as well?

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,267
Yes, at every Christmas party.

99
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,902
Sir, I am the first to tout

100
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,770
the capabilities of senior citizens.

101
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,438
I have made love to many,

102
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:45,873
but the Disco Strangler is over 80.

103
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,875
I doubt that he could pull off
an escape like this.

104
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,644
Oh, that's what he wants you to think.

105
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,379
You're both underestimating him.

106
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:53,381
I know 28 other people who did that,

107
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,815
and they all ended up with yo-yos

108
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,384
- around their throats.
- BOTH: Necks.

109
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,885
Nope, I said "throats," not necks,

110
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,555
which means I haven't told
that story too many times.

111
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,291
All right, lace up your dancing shoes

112
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:07,150
because it's time to catch
this disco bastard.

113
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,191
Thank you for coming in, Ms. Brennan.

114
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:11,599
Can you describe your working
relationship with Mr. Haggerty?

115
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:14,001
Absolutely. Seth hired
me three years ago

116
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:16,571
to help with large-scale
statistical arbitrage

117
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,839
and ever since we've been
at a steady 18% yield.

118
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:19,874
I didn't know most of those words,

119
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,576
but I'm assuming it means
you're good at business.

120
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,744
I am good. I brought in $168 million

121
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,012
to the firm last quarter.

122
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,581
Wow, that's a lot of money.

123
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,583
Where do you keep it all?
It's in a computer.

124
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:29,650
I've watched too much "DuckTales."

125
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:31,752
No, you can never watch
too much "DuckTales."

126
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:33,754
It's my dream to have a gold coin pool.

127
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,523
- Like Scrooge McD. Continue.
- Look.

128
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:37,525
I love my job,
and I'm really good at it.

129
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,927
I would never do anything
to jeopardize what I have,

130
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,696
and I'm not a violent person,

131
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:43,730
but last night Seth crossed a line.

132
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,016
Can you tell us what happened?

133
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:48,986
I was working late, and
he called me into his office.

134
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,521
He had clearly been drinking,

135
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,989
and before I knew it,
he pushed me into a desk

136
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,624
and he tried to take my clothes off.

137
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,326
So I grabbed his stupid golf club

138
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,660
and I hit him in the Cookie Monster,

139
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:58,362
which is what he calls
his penis, by the way.

140
00:04:58,397 --> 00:04:59,430
- Gross.
- He's the worst.

141
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,898
My only regret is that I didn't get

142
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,900
in two extra whacks
for each of his testicles.

143
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,234
What does he call those? Bert and Ernie?

144
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,221
You are actually correct.

145
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:06,682
Ugh, I hate that I got that right.

146
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,238
So in conclusion:

147
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,473
the burns on Zumowski's body
are consistent

148
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:12,191
with a massive vehicle fire.

149
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:14,795
- If this even is his body.
- Excuse me?

150
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,963
We're talking about
the Disco Strangler...

151
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:18,965
a serial killer, who for six years

152
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,750
stayed one step ahead
of the entire NYPD.

153
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:23,687
Not sure he had many steps
left in him, sir.

154
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:24,788
- Take a look.
- Aw.

155
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:28,156
- He looks fragile and sweet.
- Sweet as poison pie.

156
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:30,093
Were you able to match
the dental records

157
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:32,262
- to the Disco Strangler?
- No, the body had no teeth.

158
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:33,963
- Well, that's suspicious.
- Not really.

159
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:35,357
Zumowski didn't have any teeth either.

160
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,494
- Due to him being very old?
- Yes.

161
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,598
What about the fact that
this corpse is 71 inches tall

162
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,688
when the Disco Strangler was 76?

163
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:43,923
He shrank over time.

164
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,824
Is that another old person thing?

165
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,692
Yes, it is. Another old person thing.

166
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:48,628
- Mm-hmm.
- We also have a DNA match

167
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:49,762
between hair on the head

168
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,030
of this body and the Disco Strangler.

169
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:52,665
Sir, this is clearly Zumowski.

170
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,699
And that's a good thing.

171
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:55,390
You can finally say good-bye
to your nemesis.

172
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:56,903
Thanks, sergeant. That's a nice thought.

173
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,187
For an idiot to have. Look at this.

174
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:00,356
A dirty little string?

175
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:01,557
Oh, it's not just any old string.

176
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:04,593
It's a yo-yo string, the most
dangerous part of the yo-yo.

177
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:06,061
The Strangler wanted me to find this.

178
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:08,964
He's out there, and he's taunting me.

179
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,432
[door opens]

180
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,601
Okay, Ms. Brennan, we've discussed it,

181
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:14,403
and we think you should file charges

182
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,472
against Mr. Haggerty for sexual assault.

183
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:19,241
Now, I'm not gonna lie to you,
it's a difficult process...

184
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:21,162
Actually, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

185
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:23,061
I don't wanna press charges.

186
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:25,030
The firm just offered me $2.5 million

187
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,432
if I sign an NDA and let this slide.

188
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:29,493
Wait, so you're gonna let
Seth get off Scot-free?

189
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:30,602
Well, that money would go a long way

190
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:32,671
towards the Scrooge pool.
Sorry, ignore me.

191
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,039
- "DuckTales." Woo-oo.
- I mean, I think

192
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:35,257
I have to take it.

193
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,409
This is a "he said, she said,"
situation.

194
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:38,910
I know how that goes down.

195
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,609
No one's gonna convict him
on my word alone.

196
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:43,915
The system's as broken as Seth's dong.

197
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,784
No, it's not. I'm the system.

198
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,185
And I'm nothing like Seth's dong.

199
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,987
It feels like we can move off
this analogy.

200
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,922
Just don't sign that NDA right now.

201
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,657
Give us a chance to bring
this guy to justice.

202
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:53,892
And how are you gonna do that?

203
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,842
By working our asses off to find proof

204
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:57,578
that he assaulted you, and when we do,

205
00:06:57,613 --> 00:06:59,246
he will go to jail for what he did.

206
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,082
I really think we can get him.

207
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,167
Okay. Yeah, let's do this.

208
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,224
Oh, man, I'm reading Keri's statement.

209
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,427
If I was a woman, I would
not work in finance.

210
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:15,930
Oh, because it's so easy
for women everywhere else.

211
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,533
Okay, I can tell that I am in trouble.

212
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:18,688
You're not in trouble.

213
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:20,236
I just don't think that men understand

214
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,571
how different everything is for us.

215
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:24,540
I can think of a million
examples from this week alone.

216
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:25,774
Oh, sick!

217
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,476
Oh, sick!

218
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:28,878
- Have a great day.
- Oh, thanks.

219
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:30,246
- You too.
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,781
You have a beautiful mouth.
Have a great day.

221
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:34,450
Excuse me, Miss, do you know where

222
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:35,951
I can find a police officer?

223
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:37,887
Uh, sir, you're a police officer, right?

224
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:39,555
- Yeah, I'm a detective.
- Oh, thank God.

225
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,923
I'm in uniform!

226
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,224
Oh, that's why you yelled that.

227
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,592
I thought you were just excited

228
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,094
about your general love of uniforms.

229
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,962
Usually when I yell that,
it is because of my love

230
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:49,265
of uniforms but not today.

231
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,133
Today it was because
of that sexist jerk.

232
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:54,670
God, how many creeps have
I not noticed before... oh, no.

233
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:56,672
The fruit seller guy on
our corner, is he a creep?

234
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:59,174
No, he's a real gentleman,
which is surprising

235
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:01,143
because he's always holding
those two cantaloupes

236
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,612
and the opportunity to be gross
is right there.

237
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:04,980
Is it? I've never even
noticed that before.

238
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:07,082
I never wanted to make
a comment or anything

239
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,685
like that and thought better.
[sniffles] Anyways.

240
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,654
I am genuinely very sorry

241
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,663
that this is something you have
to go through all the time.

242
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,389
It's okay. I'm used to it.

243
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,625
That's even sadder.

244
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,694
I know. But you know what's not sad?

245
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:20,162
That Keri didn't take that insane amount

246
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:21,530
of hush money, and now we get

247
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:22,731
- to put a bad guy in jail.
- Amen.

248
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,833
Wait, her firm offered her
a big deal and you told her

249
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:25,968
- not to take it?
- Yeah.

250
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:27,169
Because that would mean letting

251
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:28,504
a sexual assaulter go free.

252
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,433
Do you have any physical evidence
to prove that he did it?

253
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,303
No.

254
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:32,764
So it sounds like he might
go free anyway.

255
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,177
I mean, at least if she takes the deal,
she won't walk away with nothing.

256
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:36,854
I'm surprised you feel like that.

257
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,789
You're such a feminist.

258
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:38,981
I feel like maybe I shouldn't be here.

259
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:40,584
I am a feminist, but I'm also a realist.

260
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,617
I'm just looking out for the victim.

261
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:43,586
Or should I be here because men
should be part of the conversation?

262
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,598
Let's say best case scenario
you do find evidence.

263
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,855
She's still gonna have to go
through a very public trial

264
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:49,558
where they drag her name
through the mud.

265
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:50,893
Even if she wins, she still loses.

266
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:52,194
It's two steps forward, one step back.

267
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,529
I've landed on active listening.

268
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:54,530
I will no longer be chiming in.

269
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,532
Yeah, but when one person comes forward,

270
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,104
it inspires others to speak up.

271
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,702
And that's a hell
of a lot better than taking

272
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,670
a deal that lets
sexual predators walk free.

273
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:02,972
Dude, obviously, I get that.

274
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:06,141
I'm just saying, remember that
there's a very real woman here

275
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:08,010
whose career and life
are gonna be affected

276
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:09,364
by you pursuing this case.

277
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,247
I'm just saying,
consider what's best for her.

278
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,754
All right, the state police
is deploying 30 men

279
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:21,023
and four helicopters to comb
the area of the accident.

280
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,725
I felt comfortable saying

281
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,062
this disco-man has danced
his last disco dance.

282
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:30,165
Sir, it's fun to see you
breaking out the old lingo,

283
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,034
but do you think you're jumping the gun?

284
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:34,236
All the evidence points to
the Strangler being dead.

285
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:36,038
- Not all the evidence.
- Right.

286
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:39,108
The random piece of thread
you think is a yo-yo string.

287
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,242
It is a yo-yo string.

288
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:42,177
The most dangerous part of the yo-yo.

289
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:43,779
It just feels like you're
trying to relive

290
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:45,748
- your glory days.
- Absurd.

291
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:47,403
Well, what do you have
in that box over there?

292
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,019
Memories and keepsakes
of my greatest cases.

293
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:53,455
- BOTH: Mm-hmm.
- To remind me

294
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,058
of the Strangler's MO.

295
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,392
He always seduced an accomplice

296
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:58,465
into doing his fiendish bidding.

297
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:00,596
I bet it was the van driver.

298
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,231
You mean the woman
who was thrown violently

299
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,266
from the vehicle
and just barely survived?

300
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,902
Yeah, I'm sure she was very
"badly injured."

301
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:09,204
Sorry if my voice is raspy.

302
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,106
They just took the breathing tube out.

303
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,275
- But they left the BS in?
- Good God.

304
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,777
- Whoa.
- So, Ms. Park,

305
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:17,279
it says in my file
that you drove Mr. Zumowski

306
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,214
- on multiple occasions.
- Yes.

307
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:21,535
Because he had to go
to the hospital a lot.

308
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,419
He was very, very old.

309
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:25,120
- She's clearly been seduced.
- She has?

310
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:27,122
Let's cut the crap.
You helped him escape.

311
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,290
You planted a cadaver in the back.

312
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:29,825
You flipped the van on purpose.

313
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,293
Then the Strangler set it on fire

314
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:33,262
and sprinkled some of his hair nearby

315
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:34,797
so there'd be a DNA match.

316
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:36,799
Then he left behind his calling card:

317
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,834
this yo-yo string!

318
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,936
- That's not a yo-yo string.
- What?

319
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:43,672
That's part of the lanyard
we give to the older inmates

320
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:46,108
- when they become fall risks.
- You're lying.

321
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,010
You've succumbed to his groovy voodoo!

322
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:49,645
Sir, I don't think she's lying.

323
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,946
Look at this photo from the file.

324
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,314
Oh, my goodness.

325
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:55,086
So this string is just a string?

326
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,453
The DNA was really a match?

327
00:10:57,488 --> 00:11:00,422
The Disco Strangler is actually dead.

328
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:04,559
And that chapter of my life
is forever closed.

329
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:07,495
Well, that's...

330
00:11:08,815 --> 00:11:10,443
fantastic news.

331
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,668
<i>Okay, we have you set up here.</i>

332
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:13,969
We have a VR experience down the hall

333
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:16,371
where you can fly like a bird,
and if you need anything else

334
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,923
just buzz and one
of our butlers will assist you.

335
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:22,344
This place is amazing.
It's like a dream factory.

336
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,812
We're investigating a sexual assault

337
00:11:23,847 --> 00:11:24,880
that occurred in these offices.

338
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:26,181
Right, of course. I know.

339
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:28,016
This is how people get
tempted by the devil.

340
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:30,219
I see what you're up to,
platter of tiny quiches.

341
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,855
[sighs] We need to get
someone on the record

342
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,323
about Seth's patterned behaviors.

343
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,044
I think if we start with...

344
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:38,193
How many tiny quiches
do you have in your mouth?

345
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:40,195
[muffled] Five. I'll swallow them.

346
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,745
Let's just start the interviews.

347
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,166
I don't think something like
that would happen here.

348
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:45,868
It's an extremely
professional workplace,

349
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:47,002
and Seth's a really good guy.

350
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:49,238
I don't think he's even ever
bought a prostitute before.

351
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,806
Is that the minimum
requirement for being

352
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,485
- a good guy these days?
- Can I go?

353
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:54,910
Beefer's birthday's starting
and a bunch of Mets are here.

354
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:56,178
Present day or '86?

355
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:58,180
- Both.
- I'm gonna escort him back.

356
00:11:58,215 --> 00:11:59,148
Yeah, I'm sorry.

357
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:01,183
Seth has never been
inappropriate with me.

358
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:02,751
He's a really good guy.

359
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:04,753
Honestly, this is an extremely
professional workplace.

360
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,989
Dude, Beefer just puked in the koi pond.

361
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:09,825
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
the cop thing was in here.

362
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,927
This is an extremely
professional workplace,

363
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:13,428
and Seth is a really good guy.

364
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:16,198
Hey, I'm Beefer. It's my birthday.

365
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:17,866
- Yeah, we heard.
- Happy Birthday, Beefer.

366
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,067
Beefer's not my real name.

367
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:21,370
They just call me that 'cause
I beefed on my first day.

368
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,871
Okay, but for the record, no one asked.

369
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:24,907
I don't have anything bad
to say about Seth.

370
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:26,341
He's a really good guy,

371
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:29,077
and this office is... what's the word?

372
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:31,413
- BOTH: Extremely professional.
- Yes!

373
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:34,082
Hello, Sergeant Santiago
and Detective Peralta.

374
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:36,518
I'm the Deputy General Counsel
here at the firm.

375
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,353
I can only assume
your questioning has revealed

376
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:40,455
nothing negative about
Mr. Haggerty's character.

377
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,090
Only because you told them
exactly what to say.

378
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,158
We did no such thing.

379
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:45,961
These allegations of
sexual assault are ridiculous.

380
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:48,130
If they're so ridiculous,
then why offer Keri Brennan

381
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,565
- hush money?
- That wasn't hush money.

382
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,301
That was a benevolent gesture
to allow Ms. Brennan

383
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,203
to get the professional help
she so clearly needs.

384
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:56,538
However, since she has chosen
to pursue this matter

385
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:59,308
with the police, that deal
is now null and void.

386
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,976
Furthermore, we are terminating her.

387
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:02,277
- BOTH: What?
- We have a zero

388
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:04,046
tolerance policy for violence here.

389
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:05,242
And unlike Ms. Brennan,

390
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:07,579
Mr. Haggerty has actual
evidence of an assault.

391
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:09,785
He's talking about my broken penis.

392
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,519
Yeah, Seth, we know.

393
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,108
Hey, you never came home last night.
You doing okay?

394
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:16,241
No, I'm a mess.

395
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:17,542
- I miss Hitchcock.
- What?

396
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,277
I was obviously talking to Amy.

397
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,746
Oh, and who's talking to Scully?

398
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:22,521
No one. Come on, sandwich.

399
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:25,650
Ames, you've been working
yourself to the bone

400
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:27,946
on this case for three days straight.

401
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,488
Now, I'm starting to worry about you.

402
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,490
I have to solve this case, Jake.

403
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:33,425
Otherwise Keri lost the settlement

404
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,660
and the job that she loves
because of me,

405
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,262
just like Rosa said.

406
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:38,930
[sighs]

407
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:40,599
But I can't find anything.

408
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:42,667
I've read through three years
of Seth's emails,

409
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:45,604
and it's mostly inquiries about
where he could buy a Batmobile.

410
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,606
Tah, so stupid, but did he find one?

411
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:49,808
Is it like at a dealership
or something? Never mind.

412
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:53,311
Look, I know this sucks,
and I hate to say it,

413
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:55,013
but we both know
sometimes you work a case

414
00:13:55,048 --> 00:13:56,919
and you just don't have the evidence.

415
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:58,527
This isn't just a case for me.

416
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:03,422
When I was a rookie at the Six-Four,

417
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:05,624
my captain was my first mentor.

418
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,325
He helped me get on the detective track,

419
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,370
and he gave me all the best cases.

420
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:13,080
But when I finally made detective,

421
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:16,601
he took me to dinner
and tried to kiss me.

422
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,038
He said that he felt like
he deserved something

423
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:21,817
in return for my career.

424
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,309
[voice breaking] I just

425
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:27,446
ran out of the restaurant
back to the office,

426
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:29,442
and I put in my transfer
for the Nine-Nine.

427
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:31,683
Oh, man.

428
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,705
I'm so sorry.

429
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:39,658
I never told anyone because I felt like

430
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:42,127
maybe I didn't actually deserve
my promotion.

431
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,363
And I worried that I wouldn't
get anymore promotions

432
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:47,228
if I spoke up, so...

433
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:48,761
God.

434
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,337
Every time I think I understand
how bad it is,

435
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:54,406
it's just way worse than I imagined.

436
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:55,874
This kind of stuff has happened

437
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,275
to literally every woman I know.

438
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:02,659
I just wanted to help make it
better for this one woman.

439
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,889
- Okay.
- Wait, where are you going?

440
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:13,058
I'm gonna go get you a change
of clothes and a coffee.

441
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:14,620
We're not giving up.

442
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,237
Okay.

443
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,830
Hey, what if we reach out

444
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:20,866
to all the coworkers again, privately?

445
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:22,116
Maybe they didn't talk to us

446
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,735
because we interviewed them
in their office.

447
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,604
I think that's a great idea.
I'll be right back.

448
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,439
Oh, I'm also gonna grab a comb,

449
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:30,075
but you don't have to use it
unless <i>you</i> decide.

450
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,877
Okay, babe.

451
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:33,545
Sir,

452
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,413
you haven't come out
of your office in a while.

453
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,716
- How are you doing?
- Terrible. You were right.

454
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:40,752
I was trying to relive my glory years,

455
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:43,388
but the fact remains,
they are behind me.

456
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,049
My only nemesis now...

457
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,593
Father Time.

458
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,595
Come on, sir. That's ridiculous.

459
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,963
You're on the cutting edge.

460
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:53,521
In fact, you're so progressive,

461
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:55,325
they were scared to make you
Police Commissioner.

462
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:56,935
- [machine beeping]
- You're as modern as they come.

463
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,537
What is that noise?

464
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:00,738
- It's my fax machine.
- Oh, Captain.

465
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:05,210
- [gasps] Zowie. I'm young!
- What is it?

466
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:07,412
It's an aerial photograph
from one of the helicopters

467
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,814
I had deployed. Take a gander, boys.

468
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:12,083
It's him. The Disco Strangler.

469
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:14,052
Oh, my God. You were right.

470
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,621
Of course I was.
I know him better than anyone.

471
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:18,957
- We're two sides of the same...
- ALL: Coin!

472
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:20,625
You've told us this story many times.

473
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,510
And you'll hear it again!

474
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,930
So we're meeting a guy named Steve.

475
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,798
He said he couldn't speak openly with us

476
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,466
when we met him in the conference room.

477
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,068
Steve? I don't remember a Steve.

478
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,803
- Who's Steve?
- I am.

479
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,638
BOTH: Beefer?

480
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:35,774
- So your real name is Steve?
- Yeah, I hate it.

481
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,809
- Makes me sound like a douche.
- Yeah, Beefer's better.

482
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:39,511
So why'd you agree to meet with us?

483
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:41,613
I wanted to show you
this text chain between Seth

484
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:43,247
and some of the guys in the office.

485
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:48,119
Whoa, Seth describes the
night exactly like Keri did.

486
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,455
And then he writes "LOLZ, Epic Fail."

487
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,123
What's this GIF he sent?

488
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:54,526
Oh, that's Kelsey Grammer
falling off a stage.

489
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,461
- [laughs, clears throat]
- I was really torn

490
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:58,196
about whether or not
I should send this to you guys

491
00:16:58,231 --> 00:16:59,998
but then I thought about it
for a long time

492
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:02,167
and realized it was
the right thing to do.

493
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:04,669
Oh, who would have guessed
Beefer's a secret feminist.

494
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:07,172
No, gross. I meant it was
the right thing to do for me.

495
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:08,540
- Huh?
- If they fire Seth,

496
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:10,141
- I take his job.
- Okay.

497
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:11,643
Well, we got what we needed here.

498
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:12,811
So I think we're gonna leave

499
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:14,145
before you ruin the moment any further.

500
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,213
Sweet. I'll send it to ya.

501
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:16,781
Thanks for the promosh, narks.

502
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,219
[scoffs] You're the nark.

503
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,119
[scoffs]

504
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:22,830
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

505
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:25,857
All right, people, your suspect's name

506
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:30,195
is Ernest Zumowski, better
known as the Disco Strangler.

507
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,896
Take a close look.

508
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,898
This is the most dangerous man
in America.

509
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:36,501
5'8", hunched over, 93 pounds

510
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:38,203
with gray hair and blue-gray skin.

511
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:40,505
If you encounter him,
keep your distance.

512
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,307
All due respect, sir,
seems like a lot of manpower

513
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:43,808
to take down one sweet-looking old man.

514
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:46,011
Oh, he's sweet, all right.
Sweet as poison pie.

515
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:47,846
Yeah, don't underestimate him!

516
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:49,581
I know 28 other people who did that,

517
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:51,983
and they all have yo-yos
swinging from their throats.

518
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:53,818
- So you were listening.
- Yeah, we were saying that

519
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,395
- all along.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

520
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:57,255
All right, troops. Travel in twos.

521
00:17:57,593 --> 00:18:00,325
Keep your eyes open, and for God's sake,

522
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:01,753
protect the neck.

523
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,695
Hey, Keri.

524
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,331
Great news: the DA's going to
press charges against Haggerty.

525
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:08,933
I heard. That's awesome.
Thank you, guys.

526
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:11,736
Hey, what's with the boxes?
Moving to a better desk?

527
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:13,905
With a better butler and
more of those mini quiches?

528
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,908
No, I'm taking my stuff home.
I had to quit.

529
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:21,145
BOTH: Whaaat?

530
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,539
What do you mean, you quit?
Are they forcing you out?

531
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:26,057
- Because that's illegal.
- No, they're not.

532
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:28,130
But the whole atmosphere
here has changed.

533
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,734
Everybody looks at me like I'm
either a victim or a trader.

534
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,724
I mean, I'm not even on any
of the non-work group texts.

535
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,793
And last night Beefer
invited everybody over

536
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:38,208
for whiskey and cigars,
and I wasn't included.

537
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:40,044
Well, I mean, is not hanging out

538
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,481
with Beefer really a punishment, per se?

539
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:44,084
Yeah, but if I'm not at Beefer's

540
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,053
for whiskey and cigars,
then I don't get invited

541
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,556
to Vegas with Slurpie and Trundle,

542
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:49,592
and I'm definitely not
at Skidmark's pig roast.

543
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,262
Man, these nicknames are just bad.

544
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,264
I actually came up with Skidmark.

545
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,400
It's very funny
if you know the back story.

546
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:56,277
- He pooped his pants?
- [laughs] Yeah.

547
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,524
But the point is,
if I'm not at those events,

548
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,160
then suddenly I'm not looked
at for new accounts

549
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:04,564
or promotions or anything.
My career here is over.

550
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,699
I'm really sorry.
I feel like a messed up.

551
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:08,368
I shouldn't have talked you
into turning down

552
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:11,104
- that settlement.
- Hey, Seth attacked me.

553
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:12,739
And I'm really proud of myself

554
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:14,474
that I didn't let him
get away with that.

555
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,377
So, even though it sucks,
if I had to do it all again,

556
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:18,378
I would.

557
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,078
Especially the broken penis.

558
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,551
- Why'd she say that to me?
- I don't know.

559
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:27,720
[sirens wailing]

560
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:30,456
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

561
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:33,459
Freeze! NYPD!

562
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:35,228
Is that Raymond Holt I see?

563
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:36,562
You haven't changed a bit.

564
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:39,065
- Neither have you, Ernest.
- What?

565
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,301
[louder] Neither have you, Ernest.

566
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:42,393
What?

567
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:46,371
Neither have you, Ernest!

568
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:48,074
Ugh, this is hard to watch.

569
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:49,975
You're just as devious as ever.

570
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:51,644
You seduced the van driver, didn't you?

571
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,479
No, I seduced the van driver.

572
00:19:53,514 --> 00:19:56,149
She couldn't resist my groovy voodoo.

573
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:58,292
And the yo-yo string was a message.

574
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:03,022
- The what was a what?
- The yo-yo string was...

575
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,190
Captain, this is embarrassing.

576
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:05,389
Can we just take him in?

577
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,041
Yeah, you're right.
This isn't what I hoped for.

578
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:09,728
Go ahead and cuff him, gently.

579
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:12,098
This isn't the last you'll
hear from me, Raymond.

580
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,285
- I'm never gonna die.
- Sure you won't.

581
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:16,888
- Whatever makes you feel better.
- No, you're the punk.

582
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,335
Just put him in the car.

583
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,590
[elevator dings]

584
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,593
Hey, heard you guys got
that finance creep.

585
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,129
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

586
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,411
But there's nothing
to congratulate me about.

587
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:28,414
Amy's just upset because
the historically entrenched

588
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,516
patriarchy has created
a culture of victim-shaming

589
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,553
that suppresses any power shift
in our masculo-phallic system.

590
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:34,687
- Huh?
- I couldn't sleep last night

591
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:36,756
so I watched a documentary
on Netflix about feminism.

592
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:38,214
I love you.

593
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,560
Just sucks that she came
forward to report an assault

594
00:20:40,595 --> 00:20:42,128
and the only one who truly benefited

595
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:44,364
- is a guy named Beefer.
- You don't know Beefer but...

596
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,732
Oh, I've met plenty of Beefers.

597
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,100
- Yeah.
- Look this is a hard fight.

598
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,134
But it's an important one.

599
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:49,769
It's good that you convinced
her to press charges.

600
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:51,271
But she lost the money,
and she had to quit

601
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:52,205
the job she loves.

602
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,073
That's exactly what you
said would happen.

603
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:56,025
But you got the guy who assaulted her.

604
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:57,165
And look over there.

605
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,413
- Keri's coworker?
- She came forward to report

606
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:02,081
an assault because she was
inspired by Keri,

607
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:03,349
which is exactly
what you said would happen.

608
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:06,351
Two steps forward, one step
back is still one step forward.

609
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:09,178
You wanna take her statement together?

610
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:13,192
- You know it, sister.
- Yeah, don't do that.

611
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:15,679
We can be different
and still have the same cause.
