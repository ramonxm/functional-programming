1
00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:03,132
So I told Nikolaj, "Who cares
if you're bad at skateboarding?

2
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:05,631
When you grow up, nobody thinks
skateboarders are cool."

3
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:07,528
What's cool is having your own pants.

4
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:09,990
- Uh-huh. Sure.
- Jake, you seem distracted.

5
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:11,960
You're agreeing with everything I say.

6
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:14,957
We should go on a month-long
couples' vacation:

7
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:17,141
- you, Amy, me, and my dad.
- Yeah, yeah, fine, whatever.

8
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:18,367
And we should get
matching hats that say,

9
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:20,411
"Best Bud 1" and "Best Bud 2."
And wear them all the time!

10
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:21,986
For sure. Look, Charles,
don't look behind you,

11
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,061
but I think we're being followed.

12
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:24,685
I saw this guy when we were
leaving the precinct,

13
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:26,701
and he was in line at lunch,
and now he's right behind us.

14
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:27,818
Is it someone you arrested?

15
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,942
I don't recognize him, but
judging by the head-to-toe denim,

16
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:32,068
I say he's either not American
or deeply American.

17
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:33,616
I'm thinking Ukraine or Kentucky.

18
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:34,618
Well, should we call it in?

19
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,828
No. I've got a better idea.

20
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:47,341
Hi there.

21
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,132
Who are you, and why
are you following me?

22
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:50,462
I'm not following you.

23
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:53,920
- I come for Charles Boyle.
- Hey, hey, hey!

24
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,555
- Hands where we can see them.
- Chill out, bro!

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,325
It's not gun.
It's just... uh, it's a toy.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,659
No shoot, pretty please.

27
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:01,528
It's gift for Nikolaj.

28
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:03,597
Nikolaj? How do you know Charles's son?

29
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:04,798
My name is Gintars.

30
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,772
From Latvia.

31
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,201
I am Nikolaj birth father.

32
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,203
Ohh!

33
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,272
Nikolaj's birth father
who I'd never hope to meet.

34
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:13,807
Very cool.

35
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,809
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool,

36
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:18,578
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, c-c-c-c-c...

37
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:38,037
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

38
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,649
Charles, are you okay?
You hit your head pretty hard.

39
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:42,889
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I don't have a concussion.

40
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:43,922
We'll see about that.

41
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,071
How many musical numbers are
there in the movie "Zootopia"?

42
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,041
- Oh, just the one.
- Yeah, he's okay.

43
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:49,509
I don't know what's going on.

44
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:50,652
How did you find me?

45
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,332
The orphanage isn't supposed
to give out that information.

46
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:54,657
You know Dragomir, Nikolaj brother?

47
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,281
He tell me all about you.

48
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,231
Of course. You're Dragomir's father too.

49
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,833
No, Dragomir is my brother.

50
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,355
Dragomir and I have same father
but different mother.

51
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,489
Her name Anyuta.

52
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,390
Together we have baby.
That baby's Nikolaj.

53
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,013
Dragomir is brother of Nikolaj.

54
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,326
I am brother of Dragomir.
Also stepfather.

55
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,093
We are contemporary blended family.

56
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,865
Would make very good TV show.

57
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,860
Honestly, that does sound
very interesting and good.

58
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:17,231
Anyways, I was too young
and poor to have child,

59
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:20,425
but now I'm very successful businessman.

60
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,144
I have my own clothing line.
Maybe you've heard of it:

61
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,168
The Gape.

62
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:25,949
We also have Baby Gape
and the Gape Body.

63
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:28,046
- Oh, you mean The Gap?
- No, no, Gape.

64
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:31,310
Like, there are two things
and there's space between.

65
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:32,818
Yeah, like, The Gap. Like, The Gap.

66
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:34,187
The company that already exists.

67
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:35,188
I don't know what you're saying.

68
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,509
I never heard of it.

69
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:39,250
But is it a knock-off of Gape?
Do they sell clothing?

70
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:40,419
So what? You have money now,

71
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:41,900
and you're just gonna take Nikolaj back?

72
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:43,965
No, no, I don't want
to take boy from you.

73
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:45,734
I just want to meet him one time.

74
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,300
Look, I know it's lot to ask,

75
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,936
but, please. Nikolaj is my sex result.

76
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,871
Oh, yeah? Well, I walk your sex result

77
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,162
to school every morning.

78
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:54,178
No, don't use his words.

79
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:55,653
I help your sex result
with his homework.

80
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:56,617
This is bad, even for you.

81
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,644
I sing your sex result
a lullaby every night.

82
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,221
- I wanna do something.
- You will never meet my son.

83
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:03,592
Oh, yeah? Well, then I don't leave
America until I meet the boy.

84
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:05,409
And I come from white country.

85
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,487
I have very long visa.

86
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:08,954
Very long.

87
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:12,092
So I'm positive the murder
happened inside this apartment,

88
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:13,646
but CSI could find no traces of blood.

89
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:15,729
I'd like to ask the FBI to
bring in a team of lab techs.

90
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:17,741
This would require
Commissioner Kelly signing off.

91
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:20,367
Before I make that ask, is
there anything else we can do?

92
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:22,596
Um, I'm pretty sure there is.

93
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:24,098
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

94
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,167
I am now.

95
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:26,536
We need Yee!

96
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:27,538
Who?

97
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,408
Isn't it that guy that led
that seminar where you guys

98
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:30,477
turned Boyle into a mummy,

99
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:31,778
and then you pushed him down the stairs?

100
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:32,979
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Rosa.

101
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:35,445
Easy. No one pushed
Boyle down the stairs.

102
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,149
Right. We may have
plastered his eyes shut

103
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,485
and left him to wander around blindly,

104
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,887
but he fell down on his own.

105
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,255
- It was a classic accident.
- Exactly.

106
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,257
Anyway, Dr. Yee is a genius

107
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,050
in the field of forensic entomology.

108
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:48,979
They call him "Father Fly."

109
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:50,997
- How cool is that?
- 0%.

110
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,565
How are insects gonna help us?

111
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,867
There weren't any in or around the boy.

112
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:54,968
Oh, my God.

113
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,571
You still think forensic
entomology is all blow flies

114
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,774
and screw worms, don't you?

115
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,884
That's a good one, Santiago.

116
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,557
You should take the Lieutenant's exam.

117
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,459
- Hey.
- Dr. Yee has recently

118
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:21,043
bred a species of fly

119
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,752
that has increased sensitivities
to certain human proteins.

120
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:25,765
They can detect trace amounts of blood,

121
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,434
even if it's been cleaned with bleach.

122
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:28,906
Or masked with animal urine.

123
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:30,303
Oh, I was building to that.

124
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:32,539
- Thanks for stealing my thunder.
- This is nasty.

125
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:34,674
Terry hates bugs.
Too many eyes and legs.

126
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,276
Would you still hate bugs
if I told you that

127
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,411
there were thousands
of tiny mites that live

128
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,513
in your eyebrows and keep them
from being weighed down

129
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,901
- by oils?
- Yes!

130
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,117
Look, I really think we should go

131
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:45,215
with the feds on this.

132
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,398
No, we're bringing in Yee.
I'll make the call right now.

133
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:48,761
- Oh, can I listen on speaker?
- Mm.

134
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:49,791
Oh, my God.

135
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:50,947
It's gonna be a long couple of days.

136
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:53,296
You're telling me.
I got bugs in my brows, Rosa.

137
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:54,994
Hey.

138
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,930
So what's your plan with Gintars?

139
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,331
He's kind of taking over
the whole waiting area.

140
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,299
No, don't worry about me.

141
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,768
I'm watching "Mad About You"
on Latvian Hulu.

142
00:05:01,954 --> 00:05:03,254
It's very funny show.

143
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,504
Very many episodes.

144
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,151
I could sit here all day.

145
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:09,158
I don't know what to do.
He's never gonna leave.

146
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:10,816
But I'm scared for Nikolaj
to get to know him.

147
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,178
Okay, how about this?
Gintars just wants to see him, right?

148
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:14,215
We can maybe have them meet

149
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:16,398
without telling Nikolaj that
Gintars is his birth father.

150
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:17,914
Just say he's an old friend of ours.

151
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,259
Jake, you're completely forgetting about

152
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,645
the olfactory bond.

153
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,988
Nikolaj will immediately
recognize his father's scent.

154
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:23,990
Well, you got to do something,

155
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,792
and I don't think you're gonna
wait this guy out.

156
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:28,747
Paul and Jamie are
locked in the bathroom.

157
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:30,748
But Jamie has a turkey in the oven.

158
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:32,183
This is a very good setup.

159
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,800
- And they pay it off.
- It's so good.

160
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:34,901
Okay, Jake,

161
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,278
let's give your plan a shot.

162
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,738
Okay, Gintars, remember the deal is,

163
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,473
you cannot tell Nikolaj
you're his father.

164
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,541
Who Gintars?

165
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:42,575
I'm Billy Hanukkah.

166
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,411
I'm from the Bronx, Manhattan.

167
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,379
I eat pizza at Famous Ray's.

168
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:47,781
Okay, well, no need to get too specific

169
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:49,282
or offer up any backstory.

170
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:50,550
Hey, guys. I'm just coming from work

171
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:51,851
with my friend Billy Hanukkah.

172
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:53,204
- Hanukkah.
- It's fine.

173
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,261
Kids don't know which names are weird.

174
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,481
Nikolaj, say hi to Jake
and this stranger.

175
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:58,941
Hi, Jake. I love you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hanukkah.

176
00:05:58,977 --> 00:05:59,849
I love you too.

177
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:01,189
Man, he really is a Boyle, isn't he?

178
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,263
Hello, my little friend.

179
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,578
Did you have good day at school?

180
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,764
- We had computer class today.
- I am your real father!

181
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,133
My name is Gintars.

182
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,401
- You are my son.
- What?

183
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,469
Well.

184
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:10,969
That backfired real quick.

185
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:15,565
Daddy, why is the man
saying he's my father?

186
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,768
Mr. Hanukkah is crazy.
He has no children of his own,

187
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:19,333
and it's driven him mad.

188
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:20,904
I'm your father, Nikolaj.

189
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,106
- It's pronounced Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

190
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,107
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

191
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:24,108
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

192
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,109
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

193
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:26,276
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

194
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:27,617
It's okay. You say it wrong.

195
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,947
Okay, well, that was fun.

196
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:31,488
Hey, why don't you go
play over there, buddy?

197
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,784
You can take this drug store receipt.

198
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,252
It's very long and filled with coupons.

199
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:36,808
You can fly it around like a kite.

200
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:39,056
Whee!

201
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,091
Wow, kids are really basic.
Is being a dad super easy?

202
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,328
What the hell was that?

203
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:43,758
You promised you wouldn't tell him.

204
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,101
So sorry. I smelled my boy.
I don't know what came over me.

205
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:48,196
Please. I'm in town for 10 more days.

206
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,738
Let Nikolaj know I exist.
Let me spend time with him.

207
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,236
I could take him to Russian bathhouse.

208
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:53,470
- Has he been?
- No!

209
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,334
I'm not some weirdo that takes
my eight-year-old

210
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,429
to the Russian bath!

211
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:59,651
We take our baths at home
together as a family

212
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:00,905
like normal people!

213
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,666
Not sure you have the upper
hand on that storm-off, Boyle.

214
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:06,416
He's here! Dr. Yee's on his way up.

215
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,085
How's my breath?

216
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,154
Perfect. Yee's gonna love it.

217
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:11,155
This is not a good color on you guys.

218
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,189
Speaking of bad looks,

219
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,509
Sarge, what is going on
with your eyebrows, man?

220
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:15,459
I shaved them off.

221
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:16,832
'Cause of the bugs.

222
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,395
Sharon said you couldn't notice.

223
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,086
Sharon lied, Terry. You look
like a straight-up fool.

224
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:21,054
Damn, Rosa.

225
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,799
No, Diaz is right.

226
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,549
Your face is horrifying.

227
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:27,504
You should leave before...
Hello, Dr. Yee!

228
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,805
Out back now.

229
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,773
Captain Holt,

230
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:30,841
nice to see you again.

231
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:31,975
Please, call me Raymond.

232
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,144
Unless that feels weird.
You don't have to.

233
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,145
I'll answer to anything.

234
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,293
Raymond works.

235
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:38,982
So I understand you have
a potential crime scene,

236
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:40,328
and you'd like to find some blood.

237
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:42,101
Well, I've brought along several hundred

238
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:44,921
of my best detectives to help out.

239
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:47,286
Oh, my God. I'm starstruck.

240
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:48,316
We all are.

241
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:50,360
So what you made you
think of using drosophila

242
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:51,687
as a method of searching for
blood traces?

243
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:53,309
Have you ever read Sung Tz'u's textbook

244
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:55,525
- "The Washing Away of Wrongs" from 1235?
- Nope.

245
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:56,512
- Yes.
- Which edition?

246
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,374
It tells the story of
the first known use

247
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,669
of forensic entomology.

248
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:01,109
A farmer was slashed to death.

249
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:02,830
A local judge asked everyone in the town

250
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,106
to lay down their sickles.

251
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:05,583
And though they all appeared clean,

252
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,252
one attracted a horde of flies.

253
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:08,998
The insects could sense the blood,

254
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:11,092
even though it was invisible
to the human eye.

255
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:12,500
Wow, what an arresting story.

256
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:13,771
Yes, they did arrest him.

257
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:18,422
We made a joke together.

258
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,894
Okay, Dr. Yee, how effective
is your box of bugs?

259
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:25,062
Oh, well, in a lab,

260
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:26,396
they've detected blood even

261
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,740
when it's been cleaned with bleach.

262
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,318
Or covered with animal urine!

263
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:30,533
You two really know your stuff.

264
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:37,884
I know that sound.

265
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:40,328
That's the moaning of a man
who left his lunch on the bus.

266
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:42,033
I didn't lose my lunch, you idiot.

267
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:43,502
I lost my son!

268
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,148
Okay, Scully, I got this.

269
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:46,450
Hey there, bud.

270
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,501
I got you your favorite tea:

271
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:50,153
- duck broth.
- Thanks.

272
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,509
You know me so well.

273
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,769
But I'm too sad to drink duck broth.

274
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:56,209
Wow, I never thought I'd hear
you or anyone say that.

275
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:59,512
Nikolaj is asking if Gintars
is really his dad.

276
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,385
I worked so hard to have him
think of me as his father.

277
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:03,820
And now it's all ruined.

278
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:05,527
He'll probably go back to
calling me what he did

279
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:07,676
when I first adopted him: Mr. America.

280
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,495
I know you're upset,
but that is a dope nickname.

281
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:10,956
I'm not Mr. America.

282
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:12,526
- I'm Daddy.
- Of course you are.

283
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:15,291
I just don't want
Nikolaj to see him again.

284
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,481
I don't want him turning into a Gintars.

285
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,789
You have nothing to worry about.

286
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,617
Nikolaj is already a mini Charles.

287
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:22,085
He's an eight-year-old boy
whose favorite movie

288
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,453
is "Bullets Over Broadway."

289
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:26,011
So what are you saying? I should
let him spend time with Gintars?

290
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,496
I just worry that if you prevent him

291
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:28,748
from knowing his birth father,

292
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,352
that he'll build up some fantasy of him

293
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:31,584
and then blame you
for keeping them apart.

294
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,462
That's crazy.

295
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:34,016
The way that King Trident kept Ariel

296
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,339
from exploring the surface.

297
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,278
Oh, my God, you're right.

298
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,764
I'm driving Nikolaj into
the arms of a sea witch.

299
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,104
Watching him work is amazing.

300
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,305
Mm-hmm.

301
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:44,729
- I have to get a video.
- Santiago, please.

302
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,276
Hold the phone horizontal

303
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:48,011
to get more flies in frame.

304
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,514
All right, guys, this fanboy
stuff is a little much.

305
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,282
The only thing that's
a little much over here

306
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:54,484
are your scrawled-on eyebrows.

307
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,686
- Yeesh.
- Seriously?

308
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,220
- I thought they worked.
- They do...

309
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:58,391
if you wanna look
like a mean drag queen.

310
00:09:58,427 --> 00:10:00,223
I knew I should have done
a flatter arch.

311
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:01,458
This is a nighttime look.

312
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:03,960
Well, the flies are not reacting.

313
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:05,529
I can keep going, but I'll tell you now,

314
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,465
it's very unlikely there are
any traces of blood in here.

315
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,811
Well, according to my timeline,

316
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:11,382
this is the only place the
murder could have happened.

317
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:13,537
Sorry, Rosa, looks like
your timeline's wrong.

318
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,758
Because the flies don't lie.

319
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:17,022
You can use that if you want.

320
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:18,983
He's not gonna use a cheeky slogan.

321
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,577
- He's a man of science.
- I like it.

322
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:22,460
The flies don't lie.

323
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,683
Okay, Dr. Yee, exactly how
accurate is this technology?

324
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,818
Diaz, how dare you question the man.

325
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,253
Dr. Yee has spent millions
of dollars developing

326
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:31,988
and researching these flies.

327
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:34,191
It's fine. Would you all
like to see what happens

328
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:35,530
when they actually sense blood?

329
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:36,532
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

330
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:37,567
Will you hold this, Ally?

331
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,100
- Wow.
- I'm sorry, Detective Diaz,

332
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:47,182
I know it's upsetting when
a hunch doesn't pan out.

333
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:49,303
Well, it's over. The flies have it.

334
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:51,876
Keep your eyes on the flies.

335
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:54,517
Flies don't lie.

336
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:56,003
Now, that's a good one.

337
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:58,919
Oh, no, it's Santiago's. Damn it.

338
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:00,617
Wow, this was a bad idea.

339
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:02,753
Relax. He gets one
afternoon with Nikolaj,

340
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,087
and he chooses basketball?

341
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,689
Does Nikolaj even like basketball?

342
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:07,257
He loves the "Get Your Head
In The Game" number

343
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,513
from "High School Musical."

344
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:10,260
I haven't seen it, but I know
that's not the same.

345
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,429
Look at them. Does it seem like
he's actually enjoying this?

346
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,231
Porzingas!

347
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,506
Charles, can I tell you a story?

348
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,067
- Always.
- All right.

349
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:18,391
When I was 10,

350
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,270
my dad started dating this woman, Leeza.

351
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,742
My mom hated her.

352
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:23,306
But my dad wanted us to bond,

353
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:25,776
so one day he took me and Leeza
to the mall and dropped us off.

354
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,578
She proceeds to steal a ton
of blouses from Ann Taylor

355
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:30,414
and then immediately makes me go back in

356
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:32,082
and exchange them for store credit.

357
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,250
Then to celebrate,

358
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:34,903
I get to pull Leeza's Cinnabon apart

359
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,220
because her nails are too long
and curly to do it herself.

360
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:38,425
- Ugh.
- Point being,

361
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:40,384
nothing has ever made
me love my own mother

362
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,299
more than the time I spent with Leeza.

363
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:44,703
Gintars is Leeza.

364
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,005
You are my mom.

365
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,541
I can't believe I get to be Karen.

366
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:48,432
What an honor!

367
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,133
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Yes, sweetie?

368
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,270
- Can we leave?
- Oh, no, so soon?

369
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:55,472
But I understand.
We can go home right now.

370
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:58,972
No, not home. Daddy Gintars
wants to buy me a jean jacket

371
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,477
just like his.

372
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,042
Daddy Gintars.

373
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:04,080
Daddy Gintars.

374
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:05,033
Oh, no.

375
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,288
I am Leeza.

376
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,105
Wait. No. That's not right.

377
00:12:14,604 --> 00:12:15,630
Hey, bud.

378
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,180
Everything going okay in here?

379
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,324
I know you're going through something,

380
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,142
but people are starting to
complain about the moaning.

381
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:23,111
Ugh. I would give anything
to have Gintars gone

382
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:25,114
and out of Nikolaj's life.

383
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,708
But it's not gonna happen.

384
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,900
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
close the door, then.

385
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:30,787
And you can feel free to moan
as much as you need.

386
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:34,457
This is bad.

387
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,426
I know. He's been like that all day.

388
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:37,575
No, I was talking about your eyebrows.

389
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:39,429
Whatever's going on up
there is real, real bad.

390
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:42,599
Well, it's better than having
two bug hotels above your eyes.

391
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:44,341
But wouldn't they also be
in your goatee?

392
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,892
- Don't do this to me, Jake.
- Wait a minute.

393
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:49,143
I may have just thought of
a way to get rid of Gintars.

394
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:50,162
Do you still have that friend

395
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:51,340
who works on the
Counterfeiting Taskforce?

396
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:52,276
Yeah, why?

397
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:54,722
Gintars has this terrible knock-off
clothing brand called The Gape.

398
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,326
If I can get him to admit on tape
that he's selling counterfeit goods,

399
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:58,978
they would terminate
his visa and deport him.

400
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,003
Deport him?

401
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,349
Doesn't that seem a little extreme?

402
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:02,759
Yeah, definitely, but Charles just said

403
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,913
he'd give anything
for Gintars to be gone.

404
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:07,627
- He's not doing great, Terry.
- Okay.

405
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,255
But how are you gonna
get Gintars on tape?

406
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,643
Good question, Sergeant Crazy Brows.

407
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,465
Gintars is always talking
about the Russian baths.

408
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,674
I'll see if he'll meet me there

409
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,377
and then ask him to cut
me in on his business.

410
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:17,300
Meanwhile, I'll have a mic
hidden underneath my towel.

411
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:18,301
It's foolproof.

412
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,470
Before we do deal, we take off towel.

413
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:22,234
It's full naked.

414
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:23,885
Ha.

415
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:25,197
What are you waiting for?

416
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,255
I want to see where your
hair starts and stops.

417
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:29,145
Gintars.

418
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,147
Take it off now.

419
00:13:31,182 --> 00:13:32,515
Heh.

420
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:33,650
Hey, Sarge.

421
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:35,485
Holy crap. What the hell is that?

422
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,054
That is a bug-free zone is what it is.

423
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:39,122
I bleached it.

424
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:40,356
I'm smarter than they are, Rosa.

425
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:41,799
Uh-huh. What about your nose hair?

426
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,922
Oh, man. Terry forgot about his nose.

427
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,562
Hey, why is Yee still here?

428
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:49,132
Holt wants him to hand in
his case report in person.

429
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,166
I think he's trying to trick him

430
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,535
into going to lunch with him.

431
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:53,037
Wait. It's noon?

432
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:55,305
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that was lunchtime.

433
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,173
I hope they take that
container of bugs with them

434
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,880
- when they go.
- Wait. The container's here?

435
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:00,967
I have an idea.
All I need is some blood.

436
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,206
This is fresh.

437
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,809
Oh. Terrible, yet perfect.

438
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:11,731
Stupid bugs didn't do anything.

439
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,922
He lied to us, Sarge.

440
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:15,493
Huh?

441
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,156
Why's your towel still on?

442
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,589
This is business conversation.

443
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,058
You cannot trust a man who
cannot show you his full self.

444
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,298
Well, not in America.

445
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,500
Here we have business
meetings fully clothed.

446
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:25,802
Sometimes even in a suit and tie.

447
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,184
Have you ever seen the show
"Shark Tank"?

448
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,338
Latvian "Shark Tank" is all nude.

449
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:30,792
That sounds weirdly sexy.

450
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,794
No, not at all.

451
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,476
There's no female sharks,

452
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:36,312
so it's just four Mr. Wonderfuls naked

453
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:37,780
on a big leather couch.

454
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,615
Huh. Not what I imagined.

455
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,074
Hey, listen.

456
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,653
I would love to buy some
of that knock-off denim.

457
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:45,288
Okay, first of all, it's not knock-off.

458
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:47,290
Okay, Gape is true, authentic brand.

459
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,552
The real thief is Gap.

460
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,863
- Are they?
- What makes more sense?

461
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,327
That they take Gape and remove letter?

462
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:57,070
Or that I take Gap and add pricey E?

463
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,420
I don't care if it's fake,

464
00:14:58,456 --> 00:14:59,606
I just wanna buy some.

465
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:02,077
It's not fake;
you are still wearing a towel;

466
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:03,906
and this deal: over.

467
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:05,414
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

468
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:07,718
Do you wanna know why
I won't take off my towel?

469
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,292
It's because I'm embarrassed...

470
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,590
about what's underneath.

471
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:13,883
Mutilated penis?

472
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:15,651
Ye... p.

473
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:17,687
That is it. You guessed it
on the first try.

474
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:20,423
That's what's under there.
The old... the old...

475
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,457
mute peen.

476
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:22,992
I am so sorry about your penis.

477
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:24,079
It's a bummer.

478
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:25,977
But we all have things
that bring us shame.

479
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:28,698
Remember when I told you before

480
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,700
that Gape was original, authentic brand?

481
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,001
I do. It was just now.

482
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:33,296
Yeah, well...

483
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:35,538
I stole the whole thing from Gap.

484
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:38,040
And here I was completely believing you

485
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:39,607
when you told me you didn't.

486
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:40,610
Wow.

487
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,512
Well, thank you for
sharing that with me.

488
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:43,946
You are freak.

489
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:46,382
But I support you. Come.

490
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,074
Oh, no, it's a naked hug.

491
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:50,719
Ha ha. Ah.

492
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:54,023
Hey, what's up? You guys having
a little coffee? That's cool.

493
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,024
- Yee's a fraud.
- What?

494
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,359
Excuse me?

495
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:58,417
Those nasty-ass bugs don't smell blood.

496
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:00,001
And they must not
smell bullcrap, either,

497
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,463
'cause he's spewing it everywhere.

498
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:03,477
What are you saying out
of your weird face?

499
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:05,040
We put the flies near fresh blood,

500
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,473
and nothing happened.
They didn't react at all.

501
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,540
Do you know how stupid
these accusations sound?

502
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:12,364
- Diaz, you're fired.
- What?

503
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,452
Dr. Yee is one of the most respected
forensic experts in the country.

504
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:18,404
For you two... let's not mince words...

505
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,311
common fools to suggest
that you found the flaw

506
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:23,933
- in this brilliant man's...
- They're right.

507
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:24,968
- What?
- Huh?

508
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:26,843
The flies don't sense blood.

509
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,392
They're just regular flies.

510
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:30,760
But, Dr. Yee, you can't be a fraud.

511
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:32,094
You gave a TED Talk.

512
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,020
I spent $6 million in federal
grant money on this experiment

513
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,288
and I've gotten nowhere.

514
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,047
The closest I ever came
was when they all landed

515
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,323
on a Popsicle once.

516
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:41,809
But in the apartment we saw
them react to a cotton swab

517
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,692
- dipped in blood.
- It was melted Popsicle.

518
00:16:43,728 --> 00:16:45,669
Jam works, too, but it's more expensive.

519
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,347
So, Sir, you were saying
something about us being

520
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,583
common fools?

521
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:50,780
So who looks stupid now?

522
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:52,782
Uh, Terry, your left eyebrow is missing.

523
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,879
Oh, I must have rubbed it off.

524
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:55,880
There it is.

525
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:58,120
Who looks stupid now?

526
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:02,125
Jake, hey, I got it, man.

527
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,993
Nice jeans, and the good thing is

528
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:06,796
look... both legs, same length.

529
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:07,925
Thank you very much.

530
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,631
And I see it's 100% denim-ish.

531
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,500
"Caution: Do not wear near
women who are pregnant

532
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:12,836
- or breast-feeding."
- This is true.

533
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:14,121
The nipple may fall off.

534
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:16,639
Hey, guys.
Gintars said to meet him here.

535
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,857
I didn't realize you were coming.

536
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:19,617
My man, I'ma wrestle you. Come here.

537
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:20,943
Charles, what are you doing here?

538
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:21,960
Why is Nikolaj here?

539
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:23,862
Oh, he's been so happy
since he met Gintars.

540
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:25,106
I've been focusing on myself

541
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,509
and not really thinking about Nikolaj.

542
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,533
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't realize how much

543
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,482
it meant to him to know
he hadn't been abandoned.

544
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:31,357
I'm okay with them having
a relationship.

545
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:33,056
Wow, that is so great of you, Charles,

546
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,159
but I really wish you'd included me

547
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:35,590
in your decision-making process.

548
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:36,492
- Why?
- No reason.

549
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:37,605
I just maybe went in a different,

550
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,600
less-mature direction.

551
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:41,177
Hey, maybe we should leave
this area, like, right now.

552
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:42,506
Cop car. How's it going?

553
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:43,541
Hey, man.

554
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:44,821
Gintars Irbe, you're under arrest

555
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,118
for selling counterfeit goods.

556
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:47,328
Jake! You set me up.

557
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:48,971
Do you even have mutilated penis?

558
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:52,641
No.

559
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:55,711
It's perfect.

560
00:17:58,603 --> 00:17:59,537
Okay.

561
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:00,990
So they're taking Gintars to the airport

562
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:02,326
and they're not hurting him...

563
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:04,629
any more than they did when
he was resisting arrest.

564
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:07,624
Now they won't let him go
just because I asked them to

565
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:09,726
even though they arrested him
just because I asked them to.

566
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:11,294
It's a crazy system.
I don't understand it.

567
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:12,408
But here's what I'm thinking:

568
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:14,142
- I call the State Department...
- You've done enough, Jake.

569
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,182
That's nice of you to say, but...

570
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:17,967
- My tone wasn't nice.
- But your tone is always nice with me.

571
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:19,299
Wait a minute. Are you mad?

572
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:21,740
Yes, because you butted into a
situation you shouldn't have.

573
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:23,182
You need to keep your butt
in your pants.

574
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:24,656
My butt was only out because you said

575
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:25,860
you wanted Gintars gone.

576
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,934
Well, thanks to your butt,

577
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,744
Nikolaj feels like he's been abandoned

578
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,721
all over again.

579
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:31,224
Okay, but my butt was
the one that got them together

580
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,028
in the first place.

581
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:33,516
I don't feel like my butt
is getting credit for that.

582
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:35,497
Well, that's because your butt
was inappropriate then too.

583
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,084
Your butt should have never
been a part of this.

584
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,566
So now I gotta go clean
up the big nasty mess

585
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:40,644
that your butt made.

586
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,100
But my butt no but...

587
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:43,369
My butt no but!

588
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:44,827
Diaz, Jeffords,

589
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,327
Santiago would like to apologize
to you for her behavior.

590
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:48,865
I thought we were both apologizing.

591
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,960
No, I misunderstood.

592
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,242
What would I be apologizing for?

593
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:53,252
- The same thing as me?
- Really?

594
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:55,238
You guys maybe want to have
this conversation on your own?

595
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:56,396
Yes.

596
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:58,077
- _
- Okay, we have come to a decision

597
00:18:58,113 --> 00:19:00,710
that we would both like to apologize.

598
00:19:00,745 --> 00:19:03,546
We should have trusted
your instincts over Dr. Yee

599
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:04,814
and his flies.

600
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:05,749
And?

601
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:08,479
And we shouldn't have been so insulting.

602
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,519
And?

603
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:10,987
I'm not gonna apologize for your face.

604
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:12,866
That mess is clearly on you.

605
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,475
- Fair enough.
- I'll ask Commissioner Kelly

606
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:16,559
to approve your initial request
for an FBI lab team.

607
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,228
That won't be necessary.
I solved the case.

608
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:19,871
And the flies actually came in handy.

609
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:22,426
These have been genetically engineered

610
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,567
to detect blood, and
there's a whole swarm of them

611
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:27,046
at your apartment right now
with Dr. Ronald Yee.

612
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:29,072
The flies don't lie.

613
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:30,907
- He confessed immediately.
- How about that.

614
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:33,743
Dr. Yee and his flies
saved the day after all.

615
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:34,905
No, I did.

616
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,829
Should we call Yee and
tell him the good news?

617
00:19:36,865 --> 00:19:38,753
It would probably make
him feel so much better.

618
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,170
- What is going on?
- He did seem so sad.

619
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:43,743
- So sad.
- He should be sad. He's a fraud.

620
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:44,860
Shh. It's ringing.

621
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:47,757
Hey.

622
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:48,858
Hey.

623
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:50,840
Did you make it to the airport
in time to see Gintars?

624
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,365
Yes, but TSA wouldn't let him
stay in the country.

625
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:55,698
At least Nikolaj got
to spend a few hours

626
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,600
with his birth father at a Chili's Too.

627
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:59,536
Chili's As Well.

628
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:02,939
Listen, I feel bad, and I
wanted to do something

629
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:05,851
but I know you didn't want my help,
so long story short,

630
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:07,996
I made us these hats.

631
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,245
I obviously love them.

632
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:12,814
They don't change how I'm feeling.

633
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,851
Okay.

634
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:16,886
Well, I'm sorry that I messed things up.

635
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,056
But I was just trying
to be a good friend.

636
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:22,700
I know, but that doesn't
always mean fixing my life.

637
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,928
You shouldn't have done
anything without asking me.

638
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:27,502
Sometimes I just want you to listen.

639
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,719
Right.

640
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:30,011
I hear that.

641
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:33,870
It's just... adoption is complicated.

642
00:20:33,905 --> 00:20:35,644
No matter how much I want to be,

643
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,357
I'm not Nikolaj's real father.

644
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,419
Come on, Charles. Of course you are.

645
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,289
Well, that'll be up to him.

646
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:44,104
And he may even change his mind
about it throughout his life.

647
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:47,538
I mean, all I can do
is make him feel safe

648
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:50,220
and give him as much love as I can.

649
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:52,952
Well, I think Nikolaj is
very lucky to have you.

650
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:57,093
Nikolaj.

651
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:59,425
Okay. Let's take these hats
out for a spin.

652
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:00,427
I've waited long enough.

653
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:01,596
Here you go. Best Bud #1.

654
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:02,962
You'd rather be Best Bud #2?

655
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,345
I just want you to listen a little more.

656
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:05,632
I don't wanna change our whole dynamic.

657
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:07,616
Okay, good, 'cause I really
wanted to be Best Bud #1.

658
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:09,261
- I know you did.
- Clink!

659
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:11,540
- Oh, they're way too small.
- Ooh, they're tight.

660
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:12,525
- They're way too small.
- Hurt.

661
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:13,366
They don't fit.

662
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:17,845
