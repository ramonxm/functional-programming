 genius.

00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:08,004
You want us, your enemies,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,019
to help you bring down
Commissioner Kelly?

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:13,004
          - You guys consider me
                     your enemy?

5
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:14,015
 You're some of my best friends.

6
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,007
  - We haven't talked to you in,
         like, three years, C.J.

7
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,000
          - Wait, yeah.
 I'm thinking of different guys.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,001
  - Oh, Raymond, that you came
      to me to ask for help

9
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,007
 shows how much you've matured.

10
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:22,017
    You know what else shows
    how much you've matured?

       Your withered face.

12
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,012
   - Now I know why you refer
   to this as a Suicide Squad,

13
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:29,009
   Peralta, because I already
      want to kill myself.

14
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,009
  - Why don't you wait a week?
 You'll probably die of old age.

15
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:32,013
 - The only way I'm going to die

16
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:34,013
     is if you touch me with
    one of your bony fingers

17
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,017
       and drag me across
   the River Styx, you reaper.

18
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,008
                - Ah, wonderful.
                  Very creative.

19
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:41,016
                Look, John Kelly
              has to be stopped.

20
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,022
       He's spying on civilians.

21
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:44,017
           It's unconstitutional
                 and it's wrong.

22
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:46,002
            - Please.
      Do you think any one

23
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:47,022
of these jackals cares about
what's right or wrong?

24
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,005
     - [whistles] I'll help.
           - See, sir?

  There is good in every person.

26
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,022
   - But I want it to be known
    it's for selfish reasons.

27
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:53,002
       - Why would you want that
                    to be known?

28
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:54,006
       - 'Cause I've never
         met C.J. before

29
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:55,016
and I want him to think
that I'm cool.

30
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:56,022
                 - It's working.

31
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,008
              I mean, I love how
    you're taking over the room.

32
00:00:58,008 --> 00:00:59,013
- Like that?
Yeah, it's awesome.

33
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:00,022
           - You know,
    I actually wouldn't mind

34
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:02,002
         getting rid of
       John Kelly either.

35
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:03,009
        That guy makes up
       so many dumb rules.

36
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,022
      He told me I couldn't
        eat raw chicken.

37
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,006
         - And you think
    a new commissioner will--

38
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:08,006
  - Yeah, he's already on board,
      so yes, a new commissioner

39
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,010
   would let you eat raw chicken
            for whatever reason.

40
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,020
        - It's healthier.
       - It sure is, Ceej.

41
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,010
     - And what do you hope
  to get out of this, Madeline?

42
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,009
         Let me guess--

00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:16,001
       revenge on Dorothy
    for killing your sister?

44
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,009
    - I want the same as you,
            Raymond--

45
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,017
     I think what John Kelly
      is doing is terrible.

46
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:21,001
       - Yes, well said, Wuntch.

47
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,007
         So, we're all on board.
               This is exciting!

        - It might be me.

    I ate a popsicle earlier.
    - It's probably Madeline.

Now, Kelly's stingrays
can steal cell phone data

special equipment for us
to communicate with.

 - Yeah, they're analog, so the
  stingrays can't detect them.

school, and it was so cool.

 Who would want Trollskin boots?

     she doesn't betray us.

  And, uh, don't tell Peralta.

 - It was pretty real last week.

       they're in denial.

     about being in denial.

00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:14,005

     We commit a fake crime

        that he's forced
     to deploy the stingray.

136
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:19,019
      - What kind of crime?
   - We're gonna kidnap a cop.

137
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,002
     But not just any cop--
     it needs to be someone

138
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:23,009
      so high-ranking that
       it sends shockwaves

139
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:24,019
       through the system,
    but not important enough

140
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:28,007
  that their absence negatively
  impacts the NYPD in any way.

141
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:33,007
    - Who you guys thinking?

00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,002
- We're clearly
all looking at you.

143
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,007
           - Oh, God.
 Am I in charge of the meeting?

144
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:37,010
           Dismissed.
           Dismissed.

145
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,022
              - No.
 You're getting kidnapped, C.J.

146
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:40,019
       Amy, Charles, and I
     will be the kidnappers.

147
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,010
   Captain Holt is the driver.
    Here's how it'll go down.

148
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,021
    - Approaching the target.
   - All right, let's do this.

149
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:46,001
            Masks on.

150
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,007
     Actually, scratch that.
 We're not gonna use ski masks.

151
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,019
  We'll use cool rubber masks.

152
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,020
  - Ooh, we should be the ladies
      of "The First Wives Club."

153
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
                  I call Keaton.

154
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,008
      - We're not gonna do
    "First Wives Club" masks.

155
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:55,015
         - Just because
      you can't be Keaton?

156
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:57,020
         Grow up, Jake!
 - No, because they don't exist.

157
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,003
         And also, yeah,

158
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,014
        Keaton is clearly
       the coolest one and

159
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:02,016
 I don't think it's really fair
   that you just "called her."

160
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,012
           Forget it.
 We'll wear scary gorilla masks.

161
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,002
    - Approaching the target.
     - Okay, let's do this.

162
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:07,008
            Masks on.

163
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,020
      When C.J. goes to get
       his morning coffee,

164
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,008
   we will arrive and grab him.
         [tires screech]

165
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:11,012
   He will pretend to struggle

166
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:13,003
           just enough
      to attract attention.

167
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:14,018
             - Help!
              Help!

168
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:15,021
         [tires screech]

169
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:17,023
   - I'm gonna write this down
     so I remember my lines.

170
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:19,012
  - I can see that you already
      have the word "milk"

171
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:21,007
      written on your hand.
   I know where this is going.

172
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:22,022
             - Milk!
              Milk!

173
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,010
        - Don't do that.
          - Too risky.

174
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,008
 What if you leave DNA evidence
          at the scene?

175
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,003
        - Well, luckily,
  it's a missing person's case,

176
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:30,010
      so the lead detective
      will be The Vulture.

177
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,014
       He will arrive and--

178
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,020
      - No, no, no, no, no.
        Hold on, Peralta.

179
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,001
     You forgot to say that
   I ride in on my motorcycle.

180
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,005
     - Okay, The Vulture who
  rode in on his motorcycle...

181
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,020
             - Kobe.

182
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,005
      - Will take charge and
      eliminate any evidence

183
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:42,012
         we left behind.

184
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:44,011
     - There's nothing here.
  - Make sure the other people

185
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,023
        working with you
   are your worst detectives.

186
00:05:45,023 --> 00:05:48,003
 - I got just the guys for you.
   I mean, they're real duds.

187
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:50,008
     - I wouldn't even trust
 those two to get coffee for me.

188
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:52,008
              - Gerard, tell him
                 where we're at.

189
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,017
           - Brooklyn.

190
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,008
 - You know, you guys take off,
     all right? I got this.

191
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:57,013
          - All right.
     - Hey, you. Come here.

192
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,015
You wanna tell me what you saw?

193
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:00,004
            - I'll tell you what
                I'd like to see.

194
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:01,008
           Your big--
             - Stop.

195
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,013
           I'm the one
      describing the plan.

196
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,020
     - What, so there's not
    gonna be any sex at all?

197
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,021
              - No.
          The point is,

198
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:06,015
     without any good leads,
    Kelly will give the order

199
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,016
      to use the stingray--
  an order that we will record

200
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:10,009
     thanks to our very own
        Madeline Wuntch.

201
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,015
         - Not possible.
  Kelly won't tell me anything.

202
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:15,002
   He won't even meet with me.
   - Perhaps you can sneak in

203
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:16,014
          disguised as
      an old leather chair.

204
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:19,012
      - Will you calm down?
 She works at One Police Plaza.

205
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,005
      All you have to do is
         "run into him."

206
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,012
           - Commissioner Kelly.

207
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,021
- Oh, Madeline.
I didn't see you there.

208
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:25,016
I thought you were
an old leather chair.

209
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,006
   - He's not gonna say that.
           - He might.

210
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,014
       - You're worse than
          The Vulture.

211
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,017
 Anyways, give him a handshake,
      a pat on the back...

212
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:32,014
              - I heard your app
         caught a serial killer.

213
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:35,005
          - [chuckles]
    - HotClues strikes again.

214
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,002
         - Yes, indeedy.
       - And plant the bug.

215
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:38,014
      And that's the plan.

216
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:41,002
         That is exactly
    how tomorrow's gonna go.

217
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,008
            - Got it.

218
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:44,010
     So you do or you don't
     want me to yell "milk"?

219
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:48,011
                .

220
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:49,010
    - Approaching the target.

221
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:49,010
     - Okay, let's do this.

222
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:52,006
            Masks on.

223
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:53,013
- I thought we were
getting rubber masks.

224
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,014
  - Yeah, I couldn't find any.
       It's not Halloween.

225
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,023
 - These look like they're from
     "Fifty Shades of Grey."

226
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:58,015
       - Yeah, I got them
      from a sex shop, Amy,

227
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:00,011
  and we're lucky to have them.
   There were only three left.

228
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:02,015
      - At least you're not
      wearing a gimp mask.

229
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:03,019
      - Look, there weren't
        a lot of options.

230
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,013
      It was a very awkward
       retail interaction.

231
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:08,007
       Can we please just
        kidnap C.J. now?

232
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,007
         [tires screech]

233
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,014
          [upbeat music]

234
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,014
           - [screams]
         Leave me alone!

235
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,019
         Leave me alone!
       - What the [bleep]?

236
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:18,003
  - You'll never get me alive!
              Help!

237
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,019
                           Help!
       Somebody call the police!

238
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,014
                 Here, take her.
         Take her instead of me.

239
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:24,017
            [grunts]
       No, don't hurt me.

240
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:26,011
         Don't hurt me.

241
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,010
          Oh, it's you.
        - Yeah, it's us.

242
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,003
      Now, get in the van.

243
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,015
           - Oh, okay.

244
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:32,023
              Help!

245
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:35,003
            [screams]

246
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,007
              Hey, could we stop
              and get a Slushee?

247
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:43,012
   It's just that you guys kinda
     made me drop it back there.

248
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:45,016
 - What the hell was that, C.J.?
          - I'm sorry!

249
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,020
       I didn't know it was you.

250
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,012
         You were supposed to be
               in gorilla masks.

251
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,020
- Okay, so,
let me get this straight.

252
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,015
        You thought that
     we were real kidnappers

253
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:53,004
 who showed up at the exact time

254
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:54,014
         that we planned
       a fake kidnapping?

255
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:56,008
                      - Exactly.
         You get it. He gets it.

256
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,016
    - Nobody is following us.

257
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:58,020
         I'm headed back
        to the apartment.

258
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,012
          - Okay, look,
      that didn't go great,

259
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,015
        but we got away,
      and on the plus side,

260
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,002
       no more of the plan
         hinges on C.J.

261
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:05,006
                - Oh, thank God.

262
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,012
         - He pulled off
        your mask, Jake.

263
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:07,015
What if someone saw you?

264
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:10,000
      - That's why we have
          The Vulture.

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,008
             - Kobe.
              - Ow.

266
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,012
           - [grunts]

267
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:14,020
- Captain Pembroke,
what do you have there?

268
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,016
     - Did you find a hair?
          - Nice work.

269
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:19,004
                 - Let's bag it.
        Let's get it to the lab.

270
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:20,009
       - They have my hair?

271
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,005
     I thought you put your
     two worst guys on this.

272
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:23,011
   - These are my worst guys,
           all right?

273
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,008
       They're real dorks.
     They both wear glasses.

274
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,013
   One of them's even a woman.
             - Ugh.

275
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:28,003
 You said you didn't trust them
         to get coffee.

276
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:30,005
 - Look, if you can't tell what
  "coffee" is code for by now,

277
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:32,008
    then you and I shouldn't
  be talking about this, Jake.

278
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,012
          - Oh, my God.

279
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,001
   He put his best detectives
          on the case.

     Our plan is collapsing.
         - No, it's not.

I'm sorry, Madeline,
for everything.

Michelle Obama

then running away.

             - Sir!

00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,018
      - It was very funny.
       - Apology accepted.

00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:54,022
       I can plant the bug
         on Kelly there.

00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:56,022
  And since you don't trust me,
     you can be my plus one.

389
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:59,010
- Oh, please.
Everyone knows we're enemies.

390
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,004
   It would raise suspicions.
         - Don't worry.

I know just what to tell people.

392
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:06,014

394
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:10,009
       - So, we can assume Kelly
authorized stingray surveillance

00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,018

 ratchet up the pressure on him,

396
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:14,004
    we might get another chance.

397
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,014
 - How do we ratchet up pressure
   more than we already have?

398
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:18,002
    - By making him believe that
   the "kidnappers" are serious,

399
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,014
and that C.J. is in real danger.

400
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:22,014
  - Ooh, what if we send Kelly
   a severed finger in a box?

401
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:24,006
            - No way!
     I need all my fingers.

402
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,002
     How else am I gonna do
       the hang ten sign?

403
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:27,014
     - Nobody's cutting off
          your fingers.

404
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,006
    I meant we would get one
        from the morgue.

405
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:30,012
       - From the morgue?

406
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:33,003
   Man, we are always getting
  into the craziest situations.

407
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,011
  If I were leaving this squad,
     I'd miss these moments,

408
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,011
    but I'm not, so I won't.

409
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,023

       What's going on with him?

410
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,007

- Is it gonna screw up the plan?

411
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,013
       - It's more quietly
        self-destructive.

412
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:42,019
  - Sounds good. Terry, do you.
        - I have an idea.

413
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,015
So when my dad lost his
flower shop, my Aunt Bruce--

414
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:46,009
  - Charles, we don't have time
     for a weird Boyle story

415
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:47,018
           right now.
     Just tell us your idea.

416
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:49,002
 - We make a scary hostage video

417
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,006
       where it looks like
      we're gonna kill C.J.

418
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:51,010
       - Ooh, I love that.
         Wait a minute.

419
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,019
        Your dad did that
    to save his flower shop?

420
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,023
   Was your aunt the hostage?

    - Oh, come on, Madeline.
    There's no need to gloat.

560
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,005

   Though, it does feel good.

                    trusted you.

563
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,013

you dum-dum.

John, you're gonna
wanna remember this.

565

Why don't you
snap a photo of him?

566
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:27,014
           - Oh, yeah.

567

         Yeah...[laughs]

568
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,006
- Why don't you
get in there with him?

569
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:31,012
     - Oh, why the heck not?

570
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,013
My kids just got me
a digital picture frame.

          "Nine-Nine."

572
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,006
          - Nine-Nine.
              - Mm.

00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:39,010
   Raymond, I love the scowl,

574
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,008
       but could you slump
   your shoulders a bit more?

575
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:44,010
     Remember--you're a man
    who just lost everything.

576
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,005
            And done.
         [phone jingles]

577
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,002
       We got it, Peralta.
             - Boom!

578
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,013
    Are they totally shocked?

579
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,010
         Is Kelly like,
       what just happened?

580
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,013
      - What just happened?
    - You've been had, John.

581
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,018
   You see, when you handed me
      your own locked phone

582
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:00,008
  just now to snap that photo,

583
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:02,005
         I cloned it to
    a secure network server.

584
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,018
    - When you handed Wuntch
       your locked phone--

585
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:05,013
- Yeah, yeah.
I already said that part.

586
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:07,007
            - Sorry.
  I can't see or hear anything.

587
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,011
 I'll just be quiet from now on.

588
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,001
    I might chime in with a,
     "Yeah!" here and there

589
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,010
       to stay in the mix.
             - Great.

590
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,006
     The only way to get you
  to trust me is if you thought

591
00:18:13,006 --> 00:18:14,019
      I was betraying Holt.
             - Yeah!

592
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:17,015
 - And now I have access to all
 your personal correspondence...

593
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:18,015
          - All right!

594
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,010
         - Including all
    stingray authorizations.

595
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,014
        It's over, Kelly.
          You're done.

596
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:23,017
- Okay.

597
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,010
You may have won
this round, Madeline,

598
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,005
        but you're gonna
       live to regret it.

599
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,018
      You are both so gonna
       live to regret it.

600

       what was just said.

601

- Hey, Jake?
I'm just gonna hold this down.

602
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:34,010
- Yeah, sounds good.
Thank you.

603
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,019
 - When did you hatch this plan?

604
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,018
  - Peralta thought of it when
  I tried to quit the mission.

605
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:39,011
 - Hey, what's Holt's expression
           right now?

606
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:41,009
    Would you describe it as,
          proud daddy?

607
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,018
       - It's hard to tell.

608
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:44,011
 He's still piecing it together.
    This could take a while.

609
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:47,011
   - Why didn't you just tell me
    what was actually happening?

610
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,020
       - I wanted to, sir,

611
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,019
         but it involved
    trusting Madeline Wuntch,

612
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:52,019
     and I just didn't think
      you could handle it.

613
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,003
       But I'm sorry that
         I lied to you.

00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,006
              Sir?
              Sir?

615
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:59,010
             Oh, no.
           Is he mad?

616
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,012
      I can't see anything.
        Did he storm out?

617
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:05,004
      - No, I stormed in--
to tell you it was a great plan.

618
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,012
       Nice work, Peralta.

619
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:09,010
       - And there it is--
        the proud daddy.

620
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,004
- Well, well, well.
Commissioner.

621
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:13,016
           - Still not
      used to hearing that.

622
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:15,008
           Of course,
  I'm only acting commissioner

           After all,
  you brought down John Kelly.

626
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:21,015
   Wonder what he's doing now.

627
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:23,020
 - He's got a much higher-paying
   job in the private sector.

628
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,004
  - Yes, the world is horrible.
              - Mm.

629

        - But then again,
  sometimes, it surprises you.

630
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:31,013
This whole time, I thought
you were up to something,

631
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:34,007
but really, you just wanted
what was right for the NYPD.

632
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,001
            - I did.

633
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:39,012
But also, I was up to something.

634
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,005
          - Could I have
      everyone's attention?

635
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,016
    I know it's my last day,

636
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:45,021
     and I've been in denial
       about it all week.

637
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,008
         And I still am.

638
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:49,003
    So, I'm giving this toast
         for no reason.

         which it isn't.

       is on your uniform,

    be part of the Nine-Nine.

  aren't saying that right now.

I'm not gonna miss you at all,

        in Staten Island?

                         - Yeah!

660

              the details later.

662
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:34,018

        to Staten Island.

- What kind of personnel change?

669
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:47,009

     I'd only spent a month

    before I made detective.

   that's against regulations

672
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:54,011

     rectify the situation.
