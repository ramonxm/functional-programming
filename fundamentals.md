# Fundamentals

In this session, we'll cover the basics of functional programming, which is a programming paradigm that emphasizes using functions to solve problems. We'll discuss immutability, higher-order functions, and function composition. We'll also provide practical examples in JavaScript to help you write cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Pure Function

A pure function is a function where the return value is determined ONLY by its input values, with no observable side effects.

```jsx
// This is Impure Function
const PI = 3.14

function areaCircle(radius) {
	return radius * radius * PI
}

areaCircle(10)

// This is Pure Function
function areaCirclePure(radius, pi) {
	return radius * radius * pi
}

areaCirclePure(10, Math.PI)
```

Example 1:

```jsx
// This is pure function or impure function?
function generateRandomNumber(min, max) {
	const factor = max - min + 1;
	return parseInt(Math.random() * factor) + min
}

generateRandomNumber(1,100)

// The answer is: Impure Function.
```

Because `Math.random()` is not an input value in the function.

Example 2:

```jsx
// Pure
function sum(a,b) {
	return a + b
}

sum(60,40)

let count = 0

// Impure 
function sumImpure(a,b) {
	count++
	return a + b
}
```

Because a side effect occurred in the function.
## Higher Order Function

Functions that operate on other functions, taking them as arguments or returning them, are called higher-order functions.

```jsx
function execute(fn, ...params) {
	return function(text) {
		return `${text} ${fn(...params)}`
  }
}

function sum(a,b,c) {
	return a + b + c
}

function multiple(a,b) {
	return a * b
}

execute(sum, 4, 5, 6)('The result of sum is')
execute(multiple, 10, 20)('The result of multiple is')

```
## First Class Function

A programming language is said to have first-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

```jsx
const x = 3
const y = function(txt) {
	return `This is a text: ${txt}`
}

y('Hi')
```
## Immutability

Immutability in functional programming refers to the concept that once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Instead, any operation that appears to modify the value actually creates a new value based on the original. This approach ensures that values are always predictable and can be safely shared and reused throughout a program.

```jsx
// This is not immutability because .sort() modified initial array
const nums = [3, 1, 7, 9, 4, 6]
nums.sort()

console.log(nums)

// This is a example the immutability because create a new array

const nums = [3, 1, 7, 9, 4, 6]

function order(array) {
	return [...array].sort()
}

console.log(order(nums))
```
